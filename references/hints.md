# Hints

In this website you will come across hints...

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a hint.
{% endhint %}

Each hint has a different connotation and meaning.

## Info Hints

{% hint style="info" %}
This is an **info** hint.
{% endhint %}

An info hint denotes a **note** or **clarification**. It is used to add on to information.

## Warning Hints

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is a **warning** hint!
{% endhint %}

A warning hint denotes a [**warning**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]. It is used to caution the reader in case of information that is crucial to understanding, but can also be used to address mild misconceptions.

## Danger Hints

{% hint style="danger" %}
This is a **danger** hint!
{% endhint %}

A danger hint denotes a **severe** or **common misconception**. It is used in cases where misunderstanding of a concept or information may lead to problems.

## Success Hints

{% hint style="success" %}
This is a **success** hint.
{% endhint %}

A success hint denotes **additional information**. It can be used to highlight fun facts and extra information that may not be necessary to understand the concept, but is nice to know.

For specific cases, a small title is given like so...

{% hint style="success" %}
**Fun Fact** — Books (specifically paper) catches in flames at 451°F.
{% endhint %}

## Miscellaneous Hints

Some hints may have a header.

{% hint style="info" %}
## What is _Lorem Ipsum_?

Lorem Ipsum is filler or placeholder text used in graphic design, web development, and printing to demonstrate graphic elements (fonts, layouts) without using meaningful content.

Derived from Cicero’s 45 BC text De finibus bonorum et malorum, it is scrambled, nonsensical Latin that has been the industry standard since the 1500s.
{% endhint %}

This hint takes on a connotation similar to success hints, where it does not necessarily mean a note or warning, but is instead an extra bit of information that happens to be important in the context of the page.

Additionally, [larger portions of text](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] may also have headers.

{% hint style="warning" %}
## Warning

1. Warning A
2. Warning B
   1. A warning that correlates from Warning B.
   2. A second warning that correlates from Warning B.
3. Warning C
   1. A warning that correlates from Warning C.
4. Warning D
{% endhint %}

This denotes the same as normal hints, but just with more information.

[^1]: Nice.

[^2]: Like lists.
