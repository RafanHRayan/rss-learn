# Formatting

When text is formatted, it may mean any of the following...

If a word or phrase is **bold**, it siginifies a term/concept that is important.

If a word or phrase is *italicized*, it signifies mild emphasis.

If a word or phrase is ***both bold and italicized***, it denotes severe emphasis, often highlighting an area where understanding is crucial.
