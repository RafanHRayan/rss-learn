# Constructions

## Tools in Constructions

To construct geometric figures, mathematicians require...

* ...a pencil[^1].
* ...a **straightedge**.
  * In order to construct lines and segments.
* ..a **compass**.
  * In order to draw circles.
  * In order to store lengths[^2] and distances.

## Fundamentals of Circles

A plane figure is a **circle** if and only if it is the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point. This point is known as the **center**. This set of points forms the **circumference**. The distance from the center to any point on the circle is the **radius**. Two circles are congruent if they have the _same_ radius.

An circular **arc** is a _part_ of a circle.

Two or more shapes are concentric if and only if they have the same center.

A segment is a diameter if and only if it connects two points on a circle _**and**_ passes through the center of the _same_ circle.

## Length Operation

As mentioned previously, you can use a compass to store lengths and distances. This can be used to create [a segment that is the result of operations upon other segments](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]. Create a line as a workstation to perform segment operations. We will call this line the workspace line.

### Warning

Make sure this line is _**long**_, or you may not have enough space to construct your segment.

To **add**, adjust the compass to match the length of the first addend segment. Go on your workspace line and place the needle on one endpoint of the segment. Make a small arc to mark where the length of the first addend segment ends. Do the same for the second addend segment, placing the needle where the first addend segment length ends. The combined length is the length of the resulting segment.

To **subtract**, adjust the compass to match the length of the minuend[^4] segment. Go on your workspace line and place the needle on one endpoint of the segment. Make a small arc to mark where the length of the minuend segment ends. Do the same for the subtrahend[^5] segment, placing the needle on the same endpoint. The length of [the region where the lengths don't overlap](#user-content-fn-6)[^6] is the length of the resulting segment.

To **multiply**, adjust the compass to match the length of the factor segment. Go on your workspace line and place the needle on one endpoint of the segment. Make a small arc to mark where the length of the first instance ends. Do the same for the [each repetition](#user-content-fn-7)[^7], placing the needle where the previous segment length ends. The combined length is the length of the resulting segment.

[^1]: Obviously...

[^2]: Specifically lengths of segments.

[^3]: For example, you may be asked to draw a segment $$\overline{XY}$$ such that $$XY=AB+2(CD)-3(EF)$$, and be given all the segments _**to scale**_.

[^4]: The minuend of a subtraction equation is the number that is subtracted _from_. In $$6-2=4$$, the minuend is $$6$$.

[^5]: The minuend of a subtraction equation is the number that the minuend is subtracted _by_. In $$6-2=4$$, the minuend is $$2$$.

[^6]: Essentially, the **difference** of the lengths.

[^7]: If asked to find the length 3 times that of a segment, add the segment's length 3 times. And so on...
