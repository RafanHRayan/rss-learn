# Parallel Lines

## Parallel Lines and Transversals

Parallel lines are lines on the same planes that _never_ cross. A transversal is a line a intersects a set of _any_ lines (not just parallel lines). Two lines are parallel if and only if any transversal intersecting those lines forms _**congruent**_ corresponding angles. Corresponding angles are angles that are on the same place at intersections formed by the transversal, respectively.

{% hint style="success" %}
## Helpful Theorem

If there is a line and a point not on the line, then there exists _**exactly one**_ line parallel to the given line that also passes through the point. This is Euclid's 5<sup>th</sup> postulate, known as the **Parallel Postulate**.



**Example:** We have a line $$\overleftrightarrow{AB}$$ and a point $$C$$. $$C$$ is not on $$\overleftrightarrow{AB}$$. There is only one way we can draw a new line $$\overleftrightarrow{DE}$$ such that $$\overleftrightarrow{DE}$$ is parallel to $$\overleftrightarrow{AB}$$ and $$C$$ is on $$\overleftrightarrow{DE}$$.
{% endhint %}

## Angle Relations

* **Alternate Exterior Angles:** A relation where the two angles in question are on either side of the transversal and _outside_ of the area between the parallel lines. These angles are _**equivalent**_ in measure.
* **Alternate Interior Angles:** A relation where the two angles in question are on either side of the transversal and _inside_ of the area between the parallel lines. These angles are _**equivalent**_ in measure.
* **Same-Side Exterior Angles:** A relation where the two angles in question are on the same side of the transversal and _outside_ of the area between the parallel lines. These angles are _**supplementary**_ to each other.
* **Same-Side Interior Angles:** A relation where the two angles in question are on the same side of the transversal and _inside_ of the area between the parallel lines. These angles are _**supplementary**_ to each other.

## Triangle Sum Theorem

The Triangle Sum Theorem states that _every_ triangle has interior angles that sum to 180°. Extending the lines of all three of the line segments that make up the triangle and creating a parallel line to one segment of the triangle that intersects the point opposite that segment, you can use alternate exterior angles to prove this theorem.

## Polygons

### Polygon Naming Norm

A figure is a polygon if and only if it is a plane figure formed by a closed path of line segments. Polygons are named by their number of sides with the suffix "-gon". A lot of polygons have famous names. For polygons with more than 12 sides, however, it is more common to see the polygon-based names used.

## Triangle Types

### Based on Angle Measures

* A triangle is acute if and only if _all_ of its angles are acute.
* A triangle is obtuse if and only if one of its angles is obtuse.
* A triangle is right if and only if one of its angles is right.

### Based on Side Lengths

* A triangle is equilateral if and only if all of its sides are congruent.
* A triangle is isosceles if and only if _at least_ two of its sides are congruent.
* A triangle is scalene if and only if _none_ of its sides are congruent.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Three Notes

1. For side length triangles, angles being congruent also correlate. For example, a triangle with two 32° angles is still isosceles even if you don't know the actual side lengths of the triangle.
2. Note that a triangle is isosceles if _**at least**_ two of its sides are congruent. This means that _all_ equilateral triangles are also isosceles.
3. In an isosceles triangle, the two congruent angles are called base angles. The other angle is called the [apex angle](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].
{% endhint %}

## Polygon Cases

* A polygon is convex if and only if it contains _no_ interior reflex angles.
* A polygon is concave if and only if it contains _at least one_ interior reflex angle.
* A polygon is regular if and only if it is equilateral _**and**_ equiangular.
* A polygon is irregular if and only if is **not** equilateral _**or**_**&#x20;not** equiangular.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Two Notes

1. Since these relations are all two-sided, a polygon that isn't convex is concave, and a polygon that isn't regular is irregular.
2. Definitions to clarify the definition of regular/irregular polygons...
   1. Equilateral polygons are polygons where all of its side lengths are congruent (coming from the root word _lateral_).
   2. Equiangular polygons are polygons where all of its angle measures are congruent (coming from the root word _angular_).
   3. There is only _**one**_ case of a polygon that is equiangular but not equilateral, that being the rectangle. That being said, there are infinitely many possible ways to create a polygon that is equilateral but not equiangular.

## Polygon Theorems

A corollary is a proposition (statement) that can quickly be proven once another related, but more significant theorem is proven. You can think of it as a mini-theorem.

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Polygon Sum Theorem</summary>

If a polygon has $$n$$ sides, then the sum of its interior angle measures is $$(180(n-2))\degree$$.

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Polygon Angle Measure Corollary</summary>

If an _**equiangular**_ polygon has $$n$$ sides, then the measure of one of its interior angle measures is $$\frac{(180(n-2))}{n}\degree$$.

{% hint style="warning" %}
## Warning

Note that this corollary is for _**equiangular polygons only**_! This is not true for _all_ irregular polygons. This is why it is not a theorem, rather a corollary of the [Polygon Sum Theorem](parallel-lines.md#polygon-sum-theorem).

### Exterior Angles

An exterior angle is an angle formed by extending one of the lines in a triangle.

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Exterior Angle Theorem</summary>

No matter how many sides a polygon has, the sum of its exterior angles sums to 360°.
