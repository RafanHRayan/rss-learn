# Similar Polygons

We have previously learned that polygons are congruent if and only if all of their corresponding parts are congruent. Polygons are **similar** if and only if all of their corresponding _angles_ are congruent.

$$
\triangle{ABC} \sim{} \triangle{DEF} \\ \therefore{\angle{A}\cong{}\angle{D}}, \\ \therefore{\angle{B}\cong{}\angle{E}}, \\ \therefore{\angle{C}\cong{}\angle{F}}
$$

## Ratio Proportionality

If two triangles have the same height, then the ratio of their _bases_ is equivalent to the ratio of their _areas_.

A line which meets two sides of a triangle divides those sides proportionally if and only if it is parallel to the third side.
