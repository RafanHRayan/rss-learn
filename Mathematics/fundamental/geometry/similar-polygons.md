# Similar Polygons

We have previously learned that polygons are congruent if and only if all of their corresponding parts are congruent. Polygons are **similar** if and only if all of their corresponding _angles_ are congruent and all of their corresponding _sides_ are **proportional**.

$$
\triangle{ABC} \sim{} \triangle{DEF} \\ \therefore{\angle{A}\cong{}\angle{D}}, \\ \therefore{\angle{B}\cong{}\angle{E}}, \\ \therefore{\angle{C}\cong{}\angle{F}}, \\ \therefore{\frac{AB}{DE}=\frac{BC}{EF}=\frac{AC}{DF}}
$$

## Ratio Proportionality

If two triangles have the same height, then the ratio of their _bases_ is equivalent to the ratio of their _areas_.

A line which meets two sides of a triangle divides those sides proportionally if and only if it is parallel to the third side.

### Proportions

An equation is a **proportion** if and only if it states that two ratios are equivalent. Assuming we know that...

$$
\frac{a}{b}=\frac{x}{y}
$$

The following are true...

* The **means** and **extremes** of the proportion are below.
  * $$b$$ and $$x$$ are the means of the proportion.
  * $$a$$ and $$y$$ are the extremes of the proportion.
* Multiply the means together, multiply the extremes together, and set the two products to be equivalent to each other. Solve for the desired variable; the solutions for all four are below.
  * $$a=\frac{bx}{y}$$
  * $$b=\frac{ay}{x}$$
  * $$x=\frac{ay}{b}$$
  * $$y=\frac{bx}{a}$$

{% hint style="info" %}
The means and extremes of a proportion can flip, as long as they are [on opposite sides of the fraction bar from each other](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].
{% endhint %}

### Scale Factors

A constant is the **scale factor** of two similar polygons if and only if it is the ratio of any pair of corresponding side lengths.

[^1]: i.e. one mean is the _numerator_ of the first ratio and the other is the _denominator_ of the second ratio.
