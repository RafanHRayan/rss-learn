# Inequalities

## Inequality Symbols

Previously, we have look at equality ($$=$$) and congruence ($$\cong$$).

In this unit, six symbols will be introduced:

* Inequality ($$\text{}\neq{}$$)
* Incongruence ($$\text{}\not\cong{}$$)
* Greater than ($$>$$)
* Less than ($$<$$)
* Greater than or equal to ($$≥$$)
* Less than or equal to ($$≤$$)

## Inequality Postulates

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-memo-pad">:memo-pad:</i> Trichotomy Postulate</summary>

For any **two real numbers** one of the following is true: $$a>b$$, $$a=b$$, or $$a<b$$.

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-memo-pad">:memo-pad:</i> Partition Postulate of Inequality</summary>

A whole is **greater than** any of its parts.

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-memo-pad">:memo-pad:</i> Operation Postulates of Inequality</summary>

For an operation, $$\oplus{}$$, the "$$\oplus{}$$ Postulate of Inequality" states that...

For any **four real numbers** where $$a>b$$ and $$c≥d$$, $$(a\oplus{}b)>(c\oplus{}d)$$.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Clarification

Using the Addition Postulate of Inequality as an example:

For any four real numbers where $$a>b$$ and $$c≥d$$, $$(a+b)>(c+d)$$.
{% endhint %}

</details>

## Inequality Properties

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-memo-pad">:memo-pad:</i> Transitive Property of Inequality</summary>

For any **three real numbers**, if $$a>b$$ and $$b>c$$, then $$a>c$$.

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-memo-pad">:memo-pad:</i> Substitution Property of Inequality</summary>

If **two values** are equal, they can be substituted for each other in _**any**_ inequality.

</details>

## Inequality Theorems

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-memo-pad">:memo-pad:</i> Exterior Angle Theorem of Inequality</summary>

The measure of an exterior angle drawn from a triangle is always **greater than** either of the triangle's non-adjacent angles.

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-memo-pad">:memo-pad:</i> Triangle Inequality Theorem</summary>

The measure of an exterior angle drawn from a triangle is always **greater than** either of the triangle's non-adjacent angles.

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-memo-pad">:memo-pad:</i> Unnamed Theorem (Side Length to Angle Measure Relation)</summary>

If the lengths of two sides in a triangle are unequal, then the longer side is always **opposite** the larger angle.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Note

**The converse is also always true:**

If the measures of two angles in a triangle are unequal, then the larger angle is always opposite the longer angle.
{% endhint %}

</details>

## Degenerate Triangles

If a triangle's points are all collinear, then the triangle is a **degenerate triangle**.
