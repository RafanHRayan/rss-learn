# Postulational System

## Fundamental Figures

Around 300 BCE, when famous mathematician Euclid gave birth to what we call Euclidean Geometry, he defined many different—and fittingly called—definitions. The most important are as follows.

|                       **I.** A **point** is that which has no part.                       |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                       **II.** A **line** is length without breadth.                       |
| **V.** A [**surface**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] is that which has length and breadth only. |
|            **XXXVI.** A **space** is that which has length, breadth, and width.           |

Essentially, points are locations, lines are one-dimensional figures, planes are two-dimensional figures, and spaces are three-dimensional figures. These are fundamental concepts into understanding more advanced ones.

## Simple Diagrams

### Figure Interactions

Lines are one of a few one-dimensional figures. Lines are defined by two points and go infinitely in both directions. Rays are defined by two points and go infinitely in only one direction; a ray’s endpoint is the point where a rays stops. Line segments are defined by two points and always end at both points.

Like in Figure 1, different figures are defined by different notations. Lines are denoted by the letters of two points with a line hat (i.e. $$\overleftrightarrow{LM}$$). Rays are the same with a single-arrow line hat. For rays, the end point traditionally comes first. If the endpoint of a ray is at point $$L$$, then a ray with $$L$$ as the endpoint with another point $$M$$ later on the line, must be labelled as $$\overrightarrow{LM}$$. Line segments are also the same with their difference being that the hat has no arrows (i.e. $$\overline{LM}$$).

## Note

Keep in mind that a ray is only _traditionally_ named with the endpoint first. This means that $$\overrightarrow{LM}$$ can also _**technically**_ be expressed as $$\overleftarrow{ML}$$.
{% endhint %}

The most exciting part about figures, however, is when they intersect.

## Angles

When lines, rays, and line segments intersect, they create angles. Angles can have measures from 0 to 360 degrees.

### Angle Names

Angles are named based on how large or small their measures are. The following table represents all angle names; all angle ranges are inclusive...

| Angle Measure Range | Name of Angle  |
| ------------------: | -------------- |
|              1°-89° | Acute Angle    |
|                 90° | Right Angle    |
|            91°-179° | Obtuse Angle   |
|                180° | Straight Angle |
|           181°-359° | Reflex Angle   |
|                360° | Full Angle     |

Knowing the angle names is crucial for understanding how large its measure is.

### Angle Relationships

The following are all the ways angles relate to other angles.

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Congruent Angles</summary>

Two angles are congruent if and only if their measures are equal.

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Adjacent Angles</summary>

Two angles are adjacent if and only if they share a vertex and a ray, _and_ don't cause overlap with each other.

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Complementary Angles</summary>

Two angles are complementary if and only if their measures sum to 90°.

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Supplementary Angles</summary>

Two angles are supplementary if and only if their measures sum to 180°.

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Vertical Angles</summary>

Two angles are verticals angles if and only if their rays are opposite rays and they share a vertex.

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Linear Pairs</summary>

Two angles form a linear pair if and only if they are adjacent _**and**_ supplementary.

</details>

## Extra Helpful Theorem

If $$n$$ unique rays divide a straight angle, then there are $$n$$ linear pairs.

## Properties of Relations

A statement is a theorem if and only if it is true in _every_ case.

A relation is an association between two elements in a space. A relation is an equivalence relation if and only if it satisfies the reflexive, symmetric, and transitive properties.

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Reflexive Property</summary>

Any object is associated with itself (i.e. $$A$$ is associated with $$A$$).

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Symmetric Property</summary>

If an object is associated with a second object, then the second object is associated with the first (i.e. $$A$$ is associated with $$B$$, thus  is associated with $$A$$).

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Transitive Property</summary>

If an object is associated with a second object and the second object is associated with a third object, then the first object is also associated with the third object (i.e. $$A$$ is associated with $$B$$ and $$B$$ is associated with $$C$$, therefore $$A$$ is associated with $$C$$).

</details>

Keep in mind that though these are properties, they are only all satisfied only by the relation of congruence. Thus, congruence is an equivalence relation.

### More Relations

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Collinear Points</summary>

Points are collinear if and only if they are on the same line (i.e. in $$\overline{ABC}$$, $$A$$, $$B$$, and $$C$$ are collinear).

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Concurrent Lines</summary>

Lines are concurrent if they all meet (share) at the same vertex (i.e. $$\overrightarrow{XA}$$, $$\overrightarrow{XB}$$, and $$\overrightarrow{XC}$$ are concurrent because they all meet at point $$X$$).

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Opposite Rays</summary>

Rays are opposite rays if and only if they share a vertex and are angled in a way that they would form a line together (i.e. $$\overrightarrow{GF}$$  and $$\overrightarrow{GH}$$ would be opposite rays if and only if $$\overleftrightarrow{FGH}$$ exists).

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Midpoints</summary>

A point is a midpoint if and only if the regions behind and in front of it are equal in length (i.e. $$M$$ would be the midpoint of $$\overline{XY}$$ if and only if $$XM=MY$$).

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Segment Bisectors</summary>

A line is a segment bisector if and only if the point at which it intersects is the midpoint (i.e. $$\overleftrightarrow{AB}$$ intersects $$\overline{CD}$$ at $$X$$; if $$X$$ is the midpoint of $$\overline{CD}$$, then $$\overleftrightarrow{AB}$$ would be a segment bisector).

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Angle Bisectors</summary>

A line is an angle bisector if and only if the line passes through the angle such that the two partition angles created are equivalent (i.e. $$\overrightarrow{GH}$$ splits the angle $$\angle{}AGB$$; if $$\angle{}AGH$$ and $$\angle{}HGB$$ are congruent, then $$\overrightarrow{GH}$$ is an angle bisector).

</details>

## Equality Postulates

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Partition Postulate</summary>

The whole is equivalent to the sum of its parts.

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Substitution Postulate</summary>

Distinct expressions of equivalent measure may be substituted for one another in any equation.

</details>



<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Addition Postulate</summary>

When _**stuff**_ is added to equivalent _**stuff**_, the sums are equivalent.

</details>

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Subtraction Postulate</summary>

When _**stuff**_ is subtracted from equivalent _**stuff**_, the differences are equivalent.

{% hint style="info" %}
## What is _**Stuff**_?

In the Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division Postulates, the word _**stuff**_ is used. This is denote the usage of either geometric objects (lines, rays, points, etc.) or numerical measures (segment lengths, angle measures, etc.).

***

Using these postulates, definitions, and properties, you should be able to create proofs to prove different aspects of diagrams (proving that an angle is supplementary to another angle, that a segment bisects and angle, etc.).
