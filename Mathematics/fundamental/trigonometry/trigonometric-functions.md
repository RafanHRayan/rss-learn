# Trigonometric Functions

## Unit Circles

A unit circle is a circle that has a radius of 1.

In [a unit circle](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], a triangle formed by an angle with a measure of $$\theta{}\degree{}$$ has a hypotenuse of $$1$$, and two legs of $$a$$ and $$b$$ [as shown above](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]. The following are true...

<p align="center"><span class="math">\sin{\theta{}}=b \\ \cos{\theta{}}=a</span></p>

Thus, $$(a,b)=(\cos{\theta{}},\sin{\theta{}})$$.

## Radians

Usually angles are measured in degrees, where a full angle is 360°. However, degrees are not the only way to measure angle measure.

Radians are the measure in which 1 radian is the amount of an angle measure where the arc that subtends it is equal in measure to the radian.

A 360° angle in radians would be $$2\pi{}$$ radians, as the arc that subtends it is the entire circumference of the circle. Thus 180° is $$\pi{}$$ radians.

### Conversion Between Radians and Degrees

Knowing that $$\pi{}$$ radians is equivalent to 180°, 1 radian is equal to $$\frac{180}{\pi{}}\degree{}$$ and 1° is equivalent to $$\frac{\pi{}}{180}$$ radians.

## Special Trigonometric Values

### Trigonometric Values of π/6 and π/3

$$\frac{\pi{}}{6}$$ is 30° and $$\frac{\pi{}}{3}$$ is 60°. From this, we can figure out that $$\sin{\frac{\pi{}}{3}}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$, $$\cos{\frac{\pi{}}{3}}=\frac{1}{2}$$, $$\sin{\frac{\pi{}}{6}}=\frac{1}{2}$$, and $$\cos{\frac{\pi{}}{6}}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$. They reverse; do not mistake them for each other. The tangents of each are also reciprocals of each other. $$\tan{\frac{\pi{}}{3}}=\sqrt{3}$$ and $$\tan{\frac{\pi{}}{6}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$$.

### Trigonometric Values of π/4

$$\frac{\pi{}}{4}$$ is 45°. Thus, $$\sin{\frac{\pi{}}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$, $$\cos{\frac{\pi{}}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$, and $$\tan{\frac{\pi{}}{4}}=1$$.

## Symmetric Trigonometric Identity

The Symmetric Trigonometric Identity states how trigonometric functions values are related to the angles formed by their reflected rays.

<summary><i class="fa-chalkboard-user">:chalkboard-user:</i> <strong>Explanation</strong> of Image 3</summary>

If we have angle that is $$\theta{}$$ radians from [the positive x-ray](#user-content-fn-3)[^3], reflecting the ray over the x-axis would yield an angle that is $$-\theta{}$$ radians from the positive x-ray to the resulting ray, and reflecting it over the y-axis would yield an angle that is $$\pi{}-\theta{}$$ radians from the positive x-ray to the resulting ray.

Reflecting the ray, that which is a reflection of the original ray over the y-axis, over the x-axis yields an angle that is $$\pi{}+\theta$$ from the positive x-ray to the resulting ray.

The trigonometric coordinates are written and their relations are also shown.

### Tangent Symmetric Identity

We know that the tangent of any angle is the slope of the angles ray. Thus, we know that—according to Image 3—the slope of the green and pink rays are equal. Thus, $$\tan{\theta{}+\pi{}}=\tan{\theta{}}$$. Likewise, the slope of the blue and yellow rays are equal. Thus, $$\tan{\theta{}-\pi{}}=\tan{-\theta{}}$$.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Note

Keep in mind that $$\tan{-\theta{}}=-\tan{\theta{}}$$. A trigonometric function of a negative value is equivalent to the _inverse_ of the _**same**_ trigonometric function of the _inverse_ of the value.

## Periodicity Trigonometric Identity

The Periodicity Trigonometric Identity states that trigonometric functions values repeat at certain intervals[^4].

[^1]: This is _**only**_ true in a **unit circle** assuming that a positive angle goes _counterclockwise_ starting from the initial ray going from $$x=0$$ onward positively (to the right).

[^2]: $$a$$ is the distance in the graph in the x-axis. $$b$$ is the distance in the graph in the y-axis.

[^3]: The positive portion of the x-axis.

[^4]: At periods. :D
