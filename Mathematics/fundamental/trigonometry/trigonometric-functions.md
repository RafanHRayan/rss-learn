# Trigonometric Functions

## Unit Circles

A unit circle is a circle that has a radius of 1.

In [a unit circle](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], a triangle formed by an angle with a measure of $$\theta{}\degree{}$$ has a hypotenuse of $$1$$, and two legs of $$a$$ and $$b$$ [as shown above](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]. The following are true...

<p align="center"><span class="math">\sin{\theta{}}=b \\ \cos{\theta{}}=a</span></p>

Thus, $$(a,b)=(\sin{\theta{}},\cos{\theta{}})$$.

## Radians

Usually angles are measured in degrees, where a full angle is 360°. However, degrees are not the only way to measure angle measure.

Radians are the measure in which 1 radian is the amount of an angle measure where the arc that subtends it is equal in measure to the radian.

A 360° angle in radians would be $$2\pi{}$$ radians, as the arc that subtends it is the entire circumference of the circle. Thus 180° is $$\pi{}$$ radians.

### Conversion Between Radians and Degrees

Knowing that $$\pi{}$$ radians is equivalent to 180°, 1 radian is equal to $$\frac{180}{\pi{}}\degree{}$$ and 1° is equivalent to $$\frac{\pi{}}{180}$$ radians.

## Special Trigonometric Values

### Trigonometric Values of π/6 and π/3

$$\frac{\pi{}}{6}$$ is 30° and $$\frac{\pi{}}{3}$$ is 60°. From this, we can figure out that $$\sin{\frac{\pi{}}{3}}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$, $$\cos{\frac{\pi{}}{3}}=\frac{1}{2}$$, $$\sin{\frac{\pi{}}{6}}=\frac{1}{2}$$, and $$\cos{\frac{\pi{}}{6}}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$. They reverse; do not mistake them for each other. The tangents of each are also reciprocals of each other. $$\tan{\frac{\pi{}}{3}}=\sqrt{3}$$ and $$\tan{\frac{\pi{}}{6}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$$.

### Trigonometric Values of π/4

$$\frac{\pi{}}{4}$$ is 45°. Thus, $$\sin{\frac{\pi{}}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$, $$\cos{\frac{\pi{}}{4}}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$, and $$\tan{\frac{\pi{}}{4}}=1$$.

[^1]: This is _**only**_ true in a **unit circle** assuming that a positive angle goes _counterclockwise_ starting from the initial ray going from $$x=0$$ onward positively (to the right).

[^2]: $$a$$ is the distance in the graph in the x-axis. $$b$$ is the distance in the graph in the y-axis.
