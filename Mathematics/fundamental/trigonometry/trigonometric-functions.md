In [a unit circle](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], a triangle formed by an angle with a measure of $$\theta{}\degree{}$$ has a hypotenuse of $$1$$, and two legs of $$a$$ and $$b$$ [as shown above](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]. The following are true...

<p align="center"><span class="math">\sin{\theta{}}=b \\ \cos{\theta{}}=a</span></p>

Thus, $$(a,b)=(\sin{\theta{}},\cos{\theta{}})$$.

</details>

[^1]: This is _**only**_ true in a **unit circle** assuming that a positive angle goes _counterclockwise_ starting from the initial ray going from $$x=0$$ onward positively (to the right).

[^2]: $$a$$ is the distance in the graph in the x-axis. $$b$$ is the distance in the graph in the y-axis.
