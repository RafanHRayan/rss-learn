# Trigonometry in Right Triangles

## Fundamental Terminology

A right triangle is a triangle that has one right angle.

A side **opposite** an angle is the side an angle opens into. A side **adjacent** to an angle is the adjacent side that is not the hypotenuse.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Note

The opposite is also true for _both_ of the above...

An angle **opposite** a side is the angle _opened into from the angle_. An angle **adjacent** to a side that is not the hypotenuse is the adjacent angle _that is not the right angle_.
{% endhint %}

The **hypotenuse** is the longest side [in a _**right**_ triangle](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

## Basic Trigonometric Ratios

### Three Trigonometric Ratios

Opposite this right angle is the hypotenuse—which is the largest side of the right triangle.

The three trigonometric ratios are sine, cosine, and tangent, and they each correspond to a specific ratios in point of view of one of the angles that is not the right angle...

$$
\sin{\theta{}}=\frac{\text{opp}}{\text{hyp}} \hspace{1cm} \cos{\theta{}}=\frac{\text{adj}}{\text{hyp}} \hspace{1cm} \tan{\theta{}}=\frac{\text{opp}}{\text{adj}}
$$

Using these ratios is helpful for finding missing sides and angles of right triangles. To find angles, we can rearrange the equations.

#### Use in Right Triangles

In a right triangle, you would typically be given two of the three side lengths. Using the pythagorean theorem you can find the other side. You may also be given a side and an angle and use them to find a side.

### Similar Triangles

Say you have two non-congruent triangles, $$\triangle{}ABC$$ and $$\triangle{}DEF$$. There are right angles at $$C$$ and $$F$$. If the angles at $$A$$ and $$D$$ were both equal to $$\theta{}\degree{}$$, both angles at points $$B$$ and $$E$$ would be equal to $$(90-\theta{})\degree{}$$. This is because triangles with two angles in common have all three angles in common and are similar triangles.

## Pythagorean Trigonometric Identity

If we have an angle $$\theta{}$$ in a right triangle, $$\sin{\theta{}}+\cos{\theta{}}=1$$.

### Sine and Cosine of Complementary Angles

If we have an angle $$\theta{}$$ in a right triangle, the other non-right angle would have to be $$90-\theta{}$$. This is because the two angles that aren't the right angle must add up to 90°. The relationships are shown below...

$$
\sin{\theta{}}=\cos{(90\degree{}-\theta{})} \hspace{1cm} \cos{\theta{}}=\sin{(90\degree{}-\theta{})}
$$

In short, the sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of its complement, and vice versa.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Example

If we are told that $$\cos{58\degree{}}=0.14$$, then $$\sin{32\degree{}}$$ would also be $$0.14$$. If we know the cosine of something, then the sin of its complement would be equivalent.
{% endhint %}

## Reciprocal Trigonometric Ratios

The reciprocal trigonometric ratios are as reciprocations of the original trigonometric ratios...

$$
\csc{\theta{}}=\frac{\text{hyp}}{\text{opp}} \hspace{1cm} \sec{\theta{}}=\frac{\text{hyp}}{\text{adj}} \hspace{1cm} \cot{\theta{}}=\frac{\text{adj}}{\text{opp}}
$$
