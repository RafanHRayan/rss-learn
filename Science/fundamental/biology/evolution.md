# Evolution

## Organism Classification

Organisms are classified by the following factors in order from least specific to most specific. As an example, the [red fox's](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] classification is used.

| Classification Hierarchy Name | Hierarchy for the Red Fox |
| ----------------------------: | ------------------------- |
|                        Domain | Eukarya                   |
|                       Kingdom | Animalia                  |
|                        Phylum | Chordota                  |
|                         Class | Mammalia                  |
|                         Order | Carnivora                 |
|                        Family | Canidae                   |
|                         Genus | Vulpes                    |
|                       Species | Vulpes vulpes             |

The _most_ important three are the genus, species, and the three domains.

### Binomial Nomenclature

Notice that species have _**two**_ names. This is because organisms are identified by their genus and species in that order.

### Domains

There are three domains: eukarya, bacteria, and archaea. Both most latter domains are actually part of one larger domain—prokarya; this was changed by scientists to refer to them as separate domains.

## Evidence for Evolution

### Evolution

Biological evolution is the descent with inherited modification. Change over short periods of time is **not** evolution; evolution happens overs **many** generations.

### Phylogenetic Trees

Phylogenetic trees represents the evolutionary relationship among a set or group of organisms.

All phylogenetic trees start from a root ancestor. From there, they branch off at points called nodes. These nodes can represent different traits, and where they lead further down the tree consists of all the organisms with that trait.

{% hint style="info" %}
### Note

1. Phylogenetic trees may also be referred to as evolutionary trees.
2. In a scenario with a phylogenetic tree with all the organisms in the entirety of the world, the root ancestor would be cells; as _**all**_ life comes from such.
{% endhint %}

Phylogenetic trees are useful for finding how different organisms are related and even how closely related they are.

### Phylogeny

Phylogeny is the evolutionary history of a group of species. Species are classified by the evidence of common ancestry.

### Fossils

Fossils are the remains of physical evidence of an organism preserved by geological processes; fossil records are a historical sequence of life indicated by fossils found in layers of the Earth’s crust.

The Law of Superposition states that the oldest layers of sedimentary rock at the base. Analyzing sedimentary rock layers using the Law of Superposition, you can find evidence for evolution by comparing older rock layers with newer ones.

### Comparative Embryology

Embryology is the study of how organisms develop from a fertilized egg. With comparative embryology, we can find similarities between embryos of different organisms.

### Comparative Anatomy

In comparative anatomy, three different types of structures can be observed within a single organism or a group of organisms.

Homologous structures are structures from different organisms that have similar anatomical structures but have completely different functions. Homologous structures that appear during the development of embryos of different species provide evidence for a common ancestor.

Analogous structures are structures from different organisms that have different anatomical structures but have similar functions or purposes. This implies that these structures have evolved independently to serve the same purpose.

Vestigial structures are structures from an organism that are useless and serve no necessary purpose to that organism. These structures typically lose their use because of evolution.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Acknowledge that homologous structures have **similar anatomical structure** but have **different functions**, but analogous structures have **different anatomical structure** but have **similar functions**.

A common way to denote the difference between the two can be with the following reasoning: analogous structures have the root word analogy, which is a comparison between two things that generally are different. Thus, analogous structures look different from each other but have similar functions.
{% endhint %}

### Biogeography

Biogeography is evidence of evolution. Similar fossils appear on continents that were once connected and species on islands closely resemble species from the nearest mainland. Biogeography also shows how new species form, from previous ancestors, in new environments.

Looking back at structure similarity, **convergent evolution** is the process where unrelated species independently evolve similar traits as a result of adapting to similar environments.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since convergent evolution results in unrelated species developing similar traits, we can say that analogous structures are the result of convergent evolution.
{% endhint %}

## Selection

### Natural Selection

Natural selection ties into evolution, since natural selection is one of the causes of evolution. When mutations happen within a species, natural selection can favor those mutations, resulting in an abundance of that mutated trait.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Mutations happen randomly via slight alterations of genetics. Mutations **do&#x20;**_**not**_ happen because a species _needs_ it; adaptations are **the result of** mutations that were _**favored**_.
{% endhint %}

For example, we can say that in a population of 100 white peppered moths, a mutation may occur that causes a moth to become black in color. This is variation, which is when species of the same population have different traits.

These moths live in a dark and damp forest, where their predator is a type of bird species. Normally, these birds can easily spot and eat the white moths, but the black mutated moths are harder to see, making it easy for them to survive and reproduce, producing offspring with the same dark-colored mutation.

This ability of an organism to survive in an environment and reproduce is called fitness, which comes from Darwin’s famous term “survival of the fittest”; only those who have favorable traits **and** behaviors can survive in their environment and those who have less favorable traits and behaviors will slowly disappear.

When a trait is naturally selected to be more favorable for the species, it becomes an adaptation.

### Artificial Selection

Artificial selection, similarly to natural selection, also shows evidence of evolution. However, artificial selection is the manual pressuring of a trait to be forcefully selected onto a species. Domestication is an example of this. For example, wolves that were more tame were given shelter by human ancestors. Over time, wolves gain traits more suited when living with humans and branched off into dogs.

The acronym VISTA stands for the following, and represents requirements of both types of selection...

## Speciation

In a textbook, a species would be defined as a group of organisms that can potentially interbreed with one another to produce viable, fertile offspring.

Speciation is a lineage-splitting process in which two or more species are produced. The way speciation happens is through geographic isolation. When a small portion of a species is separated from each other (i.e. a portion on the population on the mainland and the remaining portion of the population on an island), they end up spending time exposed to different environments.

Over time, these species gain adaptations that are favorable to their environment, and over thousands of generations, they slowly become unable to interbreed. This breeding inability in called reproductive isolation. When this original species reaches reproductive isolation, they become two separate species. This same scenario can happen across many different geographic locations, causing the speciation of many species from one.

[^1]: Their scientific name is _Vulpes vulpes_.

[^2]: Individuals have different traits like color or behavior.

[^3]: It can be passed down from an individual to its offspring.

[^4]: The trait is being favored so that the trait can become more widespread.
