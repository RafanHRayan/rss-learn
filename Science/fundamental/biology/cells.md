# Cells

## Systems

A system is a grouping of components that collaborate as part of a mechanism to perform a specific function or process. Systems...

* ...specific components with different functions.
* ...have compartmentalization and boundaries to encase their components.
* ...have inputs and outputs.
* ...process information.

## Cell Theory

Cell theory is of the following three rules...

1. _**All**_ living things are made up of cells.
2. Cells are the _**most basic**_ unit of structure and function in living things.
3. [All cells come from other cells](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] via reproduction[^2].

## Cell Size

Organisms can be unicellular or multicellular. Multicellular organisms are made up of many cells, making it hard to not to question why cells are so small; it's hard to question why human beings aren't just one large cell.

Diffusion is [the movement of molecules from a high to low concentration of such](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]. All cells have a cell membrane, which acts as a semi-permeable boundary to the [organelles](cells.md#organelles) in cells. This membrane allows materials in that cell use to do specific functions.

### Cellular Efficiency

All cells require a certain amount of material to sustain itself. The following are volume to surface area ratios of some cubic shapes...

<table><thead><tr><th align="right">Block Size</th><th width="140.20703125" align="center">Volume</th><th width="139.546875" align="center">Surface Area</th><th>V:SA Ratio</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="right">1x1x1 cm</td><td align="center">1 cm<sup>3</sup></td><td align="center">6 cm<sup>2</sup></td><td>1:6</td></tr><tr><td align="right">2x2x2 cm</td><td align="center">8 cm<sup>3</sup></td><td align="center">24 cm<sup>2</sup></td><td>1:3</td></tr><tr><td align="right">3x3x3 cm</td><td align="center">27 cm<sup>3</sup></td><td align="center">54 cm<sup>2</sup></td><td>1:2</td></tr></tbody></table>

As the volume of cells increase, the surface area also increases, [yet at a smaller exponentiation](#user-content-fn-4)[^4]. Thus, the ratio of volume to surface area also decreases exponentially. When there is a lot of volume, the cell has more inside of it, thus needing more materials to sustain itself. When the amount of surface area is too low to diffuse enough materials through, the cell increases its risk of dying.

This ratio is called cellular efficiency; this is why cells are small, as the smaller the cell, the larger the efficiency.

## Levels of Organization

The levels are as follows...

<table><thead><tr><th width="299.73828125" align="right">Level</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="right">Cell</td><td>A singular cell.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Tissue</td><td>Multiple cells working together for one function.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Organ</td><td>Multiple tissues working together for one function.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Organ System</td><td>Multiple organs working together for one function.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Organism</td><td>All organ systems working together <strong>to maintain homeostasis</strong>.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### The Four Types of Tissue

There are tons of different tissues, all for different purposes. There are four types...

## Organelles

An organelle[^5] is a specialized structure inside of a cell with a specific function. There are different organelles in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and fierrent organelles in plant and animal cells.

[^1]: New cells are produced from old ones.

[^2]: Specifically mitosis.

[^3]: When a specific type molecule is more concentrated in a zone, A, and less concentrated in a zone, B, they tend to move from Zone A to Zone B.

    This movement is called diffusion!

[^4]: Volume is exponentiated to the power of 3, yet surfaced area is to the power of 2. Though both increase exponentially, surface area increases at a slower rate.

[^5]: Means "_little organ_."

[^6]: The process that uses oxygen to release energy from sugars.
