# Biochemistry

## Atomic Structure

Everyone knows the states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. However, these states of matter are made up of different structures.

***

### Atomic Structure Hierarchy

1. Macromolecules — A large _**molecule**_ consisting of multiple small _**molecules**_ bonded together.
2. Molecules/Ionic Compounds — A bonded group of more than one atom.
3. Atoms — The smallest unit of matter.
4. Subatomic Particles — Those that make up an atom.
   1. Protons — Has a charge of +1.
   2. Neutrons — Has a neutral charge.
   3. Electrons — Has a charge of –1.

{% hint style="danger" %}
## Common Misconception

Note that molecules and ionic compounds are **different**. Molecules are the result of _covalently bonded_ atoms, but ionic compounds are the result of _**ionically bonded**_ atoms.
{% endhint %}

### Atoms

Matter is made up of atoms; they are the _**smallest**_ unit of matter and retains all the **chemical properties** of an element. Atoms, in turn, are made up of three different types of subatomic particles: protons, which have a **positive** charge (<i class="fa-plus">:plus:</i>); neutrons, which have a **neutral** charge (<i class="fa-empty-set">:empty-set:</i>); and electrons, which have a **negative** charge (<i class="fa-minus">:minus:</i>).

Protons and neutrons have a mass of approximately 1, but electrons have such an insignificant mass that they are regarded to have a mass of approximately 0. Protons and neutrons live in the **nucleus** of the atom, while electrons surround and encircle them in **orbitals**.

Generally, **all** atoms are assigned an element defined by the number of protons in the atom; changing the number of protons changes the element of the atom. There are the same number of electrons as protons in a **balanced** atom. And there are a certain number of neutrons in an atom to make the nucleus of an atom **stable**.

{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}

### Bonded Atoms

Ions are atoms with an **uneven** number of electrons. When balanced atoms lose or gain one or more electrons, they become positively charged or negatively charged, respectively. Atoms will gain, lose, or share electrons with other atoms to have a complete **valence shell**—the outermost shell/orbital of an atom. **Valence electrons** are electrons in the valence shell. There are two ways atoms can bond together.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Note

Note that atoms with many valence electrons can bond with **more than one** atom.
{% endhint %}

#### Ionic Bonds

Ionic bonds are when an atom _**"steal"**_ an electron from another in order to complete their own valence shell. Ionic bonding usually happens between a nonmetal and a metal (ex: chlorine with sodium). Ionically bonded atoms form _**ionic compounds**_.

#### Covalent Bonds

Covalent bonds are when atoms _**share**_ their electron with each other in order to help complete each other's valence shell. Covalent bonding usually happens between two nonmetals (ex: carbon with hydrogen). Covalently bonded atoms form _**molecules**_.

{% hint style="warning" %}
## Warning

There is a difference between **molecules** and **ionic compounds**. Molecules are formed through covalent bonding, but ionic compounds are formed through ionic bonding.
{% endhint %}

## Properties of Water

### Polarity

Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is covalently bonded together (hydrogen and oxygen are both nonmetals). Water is also polar, meaning its electrons are shared unevenly. This is because the oxygen atom in a molecule of water is **partially negative** ($$\delta{}^-$$; likes "stealing" electrons) and the hydrogens atoms are **partially positive** ($$\delta{}^+$$; likes sharing electrons). Because of this, water molecules interact with each other from a **hydrogen** atom of one to the **oxygen** of another.

### Hydrogen Bonds

{% hint style="danger" %}
## Misinterpretation

Hydrogen bonds are _**NOT**_ an actual chemical bond! They are an **intermolecular force** between molecules!!
{% endhint %}

Hydrogen bonds usually happen between a hydrogen atom that is partially positive ($$\delta{}^+$$) and either oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine, of which is partially negative ($$\delta{}^-$$).

### Universal Solvent

Water is a universal solvent. When a substance is hydrophilic ("water-loving"), it easily dissolves in water. When a substance is hydrophobic ("water-fearing"), it does **not** easily dissolve in water.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Note

Water tends to dissolve **other polar substances** and **charged substances** (ionic atoms and compounds) the easiest.
{% endhint %}

### Adhesion

Adhesion is tendency of water to stick to other surfaces. It allows many functions in organisms to flow water upwards (stronger force than gravity).

### Cohesion and Surface Tension

Cohesion is the tendency for water to be attracted to itself. When water is placed on a thin surface, it tends to pile up in way that makes a dome-like structure that just barely hangs off the edges of the surface.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Note

Remember that cohesion happens because water is polar and can form hydrogen bonds.
{% endhint %}

Surface tension is caused by cohesion, which allows insects like water striders to float on water.

### Specific Heat Capacity

Specific heat capapcity is the amount of heat energy required to increase or decrease the temperature of 1 gram of a substance by 1°C. Water has one of the highest specific heat capacities (at 4.18 J/g/°C), so it heats up slower than most substances and cools down slower than most substances.

## Macromolecules

### Molecules of Life

Macromolecules ("giant/big" molecules) are molecules made of smaller molecules. There are four molecules of life:

* Carbohydrates
* Lipids
* Proteins
* Nucleic Acids

{% hint style="success" %}
## Extra Information

Some of the most common elements in the body are:

1. Oxygen (65%)
2. Carbon (18.5%)
3. Hydrogen (9.5%)
4. Nitrogen (3.3%)

The molecules of life contain these elements, and since they are vital to our bodies (energy, body functions, etc.), they are also very abundant in them.
{% endhint %}

### Monomers and Polymers

Monomers are an individual unit and polymers are multiple monomers conjoined together.

### Carbohydrates

The monomers of carbohydrates are called **monosaccharides**. The polymers of carbohydrates are called **polysaccharides**. Carbohydrates contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They are used for short-term energy; they contain less energy than lipids do.

### Lipids

The _components_ of lipids are **glycerol** and **fatty acids**. The polymers of lipids are called **lipids**. Lipids contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They are used for long-term energy. Lipids are nonpolar, so they are hydrophobic and don't dissolve easily in water.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Note

Lipids don't have a single monomer, they are built from glycerol and fatty acids. This is why they are listed as components, not monomers.
{% endhint %}

### Proteins

The monomers of proteins are **amino acids**. The polymers of proteins are called **polypeptides**. Proteins contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. They are used for building, repairing, functions, and hormones.

### Nucleic Acids

The monomers of nucleic acids are **nucleotides**. The polymers of nucleic acids are called **nucleic acids**. Nucleic acids contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus. They are used for storing, transferring, and expressing genetic information.

### Biochemical Reactions

Two biochemical reactions happen between molecules of life.

When monomers are biochemically put together as reactants, the products are a resulting polymer and _**water**_. This is known as **dehydration synthesis**.

In order to break down a polymer water is required, the products are two (or more) resulting monomers. This is known as **hydrolysis**.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Note

Dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis both carry out in the human body to help with life processes and homeostasis.
{% endhint %}

## Hydrocarbons

Hydrocarbons are molecules that _**only**_ contain hydrogen and carbon. For example, methane and ethane (CH<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> respectively) are hydrocarbons.

## Lipid Saturation

Unsaturated fats are lipids that have one _**or more**_ carbon-to-carbon _**double**_ bonds. Unsaturated fats are more tend to be **liquid** at room temperature.

Saturated fats are lipids that have _**no**_ carbon-to-carbon _**double**_ bonds. Saturated fats are more structurally organized and tend to be **solid** at room temperature.

## Lipid Types

Triglycerides (or Triacylglycerol) are a type of lipid molecule that are specialized in the long-term storage of energy and insulation.

Phospholipids are a type of lipid molecule that are specialized in forming the basic structure of cell membranes and helping to regulate what enters and leaves the cell. They have a _**hydrophilic**_ head and two _**hydrophobic**_ tails.

## Protein Structure

{% hint style="danger" %}
## Misinterpretation

There is a _very large_ difference between a _**polypeptide**_ and a _**protein**_.
{% endhint %}

Previously, it has been discussed that a polypeptide chain the monomer of proteins, as they are made up of chained amino acids. Polypeptides in their simplest form (a stretched-out chain) is in the **primary structure** of proteins.

When primary structure proteins (polypeptide chains) are folded in repeating patterns, they transform into **secondary structure** proteins. When these secondary structures begin folding three-dimensionally, they transform into **tertiary structure** proteins.

When multiple of these folded tertiary structure polypeptide chains come together, they form a **quaternary structure**, which is considered a full protein.

### Cause of Protein Folding

Proteins fold because of hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions with water. When **amino acids** are hydrophobic, they cause the polypeptide chain to fold **inward** _away from_ water, and vice versa when hydrophobic (fold **outward** _towards_ water).

### Danaturation

When proteins are denatured, they are exposed to an extreme temperature and/or an extreme pH environment (hot/cold; acidic/alkalinic), causing them to unfold into their primary structure form as a polypeptide chain.

## Catalysts

Chemical processes in the human body (like dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis) tend to take hours, days, or even weeks to happen. Catalysts can take the reactants of these tedious chemical reactions and **catalyze**, or hasten, them. Organic catalysts are called enzymes.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Note

Inorganic catalysts _do_ exist (e.g. MnO<sub>2</sub>), and they do not contain hydrogen and carbon, often containing metals (magnesium in this example).
{% endhint %}

Enzymes can help build _**or**_ break down molecules.

### How Enzymes Work

The way enzymes work is by binding with reactants of chemical processes; these reactants are called substrates. _**Enzymes are shaped deliberately to bind with a specific substrate(s).**_ A substrate(s) bind to an enzyme in an area at the enzyme called the active site. After binding, the enzyme and substrate (or substrates) form an enzyme-substrate complex. The enzyme then speeds up the reaction, unbinds with, and releases the products of the reaction. Enzymes are never used up, and can catalyze the same reaction for a different substrate(s).

{% hint style="info" %}
## Note

Denaturing an enzyme makes it unable to catalyze reactions.

Enzymes are a special type of _**protein**_. This means that they can be denatured. When an enzyme unfolds, it loses its three-dimensional shape; the same shape that is specific to the substrates. This makes the enzyme **unable** to bind with and catalyze reactions with substrates.
{% endhint %}

Enzymes speed up the reaction by reducing the amount of activation energy required to cause the chemical reaction. Activation energy is the amount of energy required to cause a chemical reaction to happen. When the amount of activation energy required is reduced, the _**time**_ required to cause the chemical reaction to happen is also reduced.

### Models of Enzymes

#### The Lock & Key Model

Enzymes are often associated with the analogy of a lock and key. As in, the lock (enzyme) will only allow a perfect fit with a specific key (substrate).

#### The Induced Fit Model

The model represents that an enzyme only partially maintains the shape of its substrates. When the first substrate binds to the enzyme, the former slightly changes the active site of the latter to better fit the second substrate.

### Optimum Environments

An enzyme tends to work best in a specifically suited environment. The temperature and pH of this environment are referred to as the optimum pH and temperature.

In an environment of a lower or higher pH, the enzymes reaction rate (the rate an enzyme catalyzed reactions) will slowly decline on both extremities, until the enzyme fully denatures and is unable to catalyze reactions.

In an environment of a lower temperature, there isn't much kinetic energy; temperature is the amount of kinetic energy. Since there isn't enough energy, enzymes are unable to catalyze with reactions as well. In an environment of a higher temperature, there is too much kinetic energy, and the enzyme begins to unfold until it has fully denatured.
