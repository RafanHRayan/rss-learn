# Cellular Respiration???

## Respiratory System

The **respiratory system** facilitates [gas exchange](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

## Fun Fact

This all happens in the _small_ time that you breathe! Steps 1-8 happen as you breathe in and steps 9-10 happen as you breathe out.

#### Outside Environment

Oxygen resides in the environment.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Nose/Mouth

When you inhale, you force oxygen in through your nose and/or mouth.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Pharynx

The **pharynx** is also you _throat_. Oxygen travels down through here.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Larynx

The **larynx** is also your _voice box_. Oxygen travels downward through here.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Trachea

Oxygen continues to travel downward through your **trachea**.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Bronchi

Oxygen travels down the main **bronchi** before it divides into two, leading to both the left and right lungs.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Bronchioles

Oxygen branches into many small **bronchioles** from the main bronchi.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Alveoli to Red Blood Cells

Oxygen reaches small sacs, called alveoli[^2]. They diffuse through the extremely thin respiratory membrane and into the capillaries.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Backtrack


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Back to Outside Environment

Carbon dioxide is released into the environment as you exhale.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

[^1]: Oxygen goes in and carbon dioxide goes out.

[^2]: _sing._ **alveolus**
