# Cellular Respiration???

## Respiratory System

The **respiratory system** facilitates [gas exchange](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

### Steps of Gas Exchange

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Outside Environment

Oxygen resides in the environment.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Nose/Mouth

When you inhale, you force oxygen in through your nose and/or mouth.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Pharynx

The **pharynx** is also you _throat_. Oxygen travels down through here.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Larynx

The **larynx** is also your _voice box_. Oxygen travels downward through here.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Trachea

Oxygen continues to travel downward through your **trachea**.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Bronchi

Oxygen travels down the main **bronchi** before it divides into two, leading to both the left and right lungs.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Bronchioles

Oxygen branches into many small **bronchioles** from the main bronchi.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Alveoli to Red Blood Cells

Oxygen reaches small sacs, called [**alveoli**](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]. They diffuse through the extremely thin [**respiratory membrane**](#user-content-fn-3)[^3] and into the capillaries, where red blood cells take them. These blood cells then release carbon dioxide, which is pushed back into the alveoli.

The reason oxygen and carbon dioxide can exchange here is because of [diffusion](cells.md#cell-size).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Backtrack

Carbon dioxide from the capillaries backtrack through the entire respiratory system.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Back to Outside Environment

Carbon dioxide is released into the environment as you exhale.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

**Fun Fact** — This all happens in the _small_ time that you breathe! Steps 1-8 happen as you breathe in and steps 9-10 happen as you breathe out.

### How Breathing Works

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-scale-balanced">:scale-balanced:</i> Boyle's Law</summary>

As volume increases, pressure decreases.

</details>

The **diaphragm** is a parachute-shaped muscle that is attached to the spine, ribs, and sternum. When you inhale, the diaphragm contracts[^4], pressure _decreases_, and your lungs fill up with air. When you exhale, the diaphragm relaxes, pressure _increases_, and your lungs release air.

### Breathing at High Altitudes

The reason it gets harder to breathe at higher altitudes is because of the concentration gradient. Less oxygen is present at higher altitudes, thus [there is a gentler slope in the concentration gradient](#user-content-fn-5)[^5]. Oxygen, in turn, diffuses slower making it harder to breathe it in.

[^1]: Oxygen goes in and carbon dioxide goes out.

[^2]: _sing._ **alveolus**

[^3]: The respiratory membrane is the area where the alveoli walls and capillary walls touch.

    ‎‎‎‎‎‎‎‎ㅤ

    Both walls are approximately one cell thick, making it extremely easy for oxygen and carbon dioxide to diffuse through.

[^4]: When you diaphragm contracts, it essentially _**expands**_.

[^5]: Hypothetically, say a person has 35 molecules of oxygen in them. At sea level, there is approximately 500 atoms of oxygen. At a high altitude, there is only 300 atoms of oxygen.

    ㅤ

    Because the gradient from 300 to 32 is gentler than the gradient from 500 to 32, oxygen diffuses slower and breathing becomes harder.
