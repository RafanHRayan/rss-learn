# Human Impact

## Renewable vs. Nonrenewable Resources

A renewable resource is a resource that is _unlimited_ and can always be regenerated. For example, solar energy, vegetable oils and animal fats, wood, and crops are all different examples of, but not all, renewable resources.

On the other hand, nonrenewable resources are _limited_ on earth; once it is used, its gone. The main nonrenewable resource that humans are dependant on is, of course, fossil fuels.

## Climate Change

Climate change is the [long term shift in weather patterns](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]. It is most commonly caused by the [increase in concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide](#user-content-fn-2)[^2].

### The Greenhouse Effect

The sun radiates _UV rays_ to Earth. When these UV rays hit Earth, they are reradiated back as _infared radiation_. Greenhouse gases—like carbon dioxide, methane[^3], and nitrous oxide—trap this infrared radiation, warming up the planet more than it should be.

{% hint style="danger" %}
## Misconception

Note that global warming is a _cause_ of climate change. They are _**not**_ the same!
{% endhint %}

### Effects of Global Warming

Many things are influenced by global warming. Floods, melting ice caps, tropical storms, and droughts are all such.

#### Environmental Effects

Temperature changes and extinction rates over the past 450 million years show that species are dying off at faster rates in comparison to increases in temperature.

#### Economic Effects

Constant disasters have caused an increase in costs due to the rising needs of recovery.

#### Human Health Effects

According to many studies, more people aged 65 years or older have started to become exposed to heat waves compared to those during previous years.

### Causation vs. Correlation

Causation is when one variable _directly affects_ another variable. Correlation is when two variables are _related_.

## Engineering Design Process

The following are the steps to the engineering design process.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Define a problem

Figure out what your trying to resolve, understand your constraints, and [gather necessary materials](#user-content-fn-4)[^4].
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Brainstorm solutions

Brainstorm to formulate a possible[^5] plan in solving your problem.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Research externally

Do external research to figure out more about your topic.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Design and test a prototype

Your prototype is your _**first**_ iteration of a solution. Test your prototype and record the pros and cons.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Iterate your prototype

[Iterate your prototype](#user-content-fn-6)[^6] to more efficiently solve your problem.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Communicate results

Communicate results with [other people](#user-content-fn-7)[^7]. It is important to let others understand your solution and for them to repeat and revise your experiment.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Tradeoffs vs. Drawbacks

A **tradeoff** is a _deliberate_ decision made to balance conflicting design requirements, accepting a compromise in one area to achieve an advantage in another. A **drawback** is an _undesirable_ limitation that exists within a design choice.

The key difference is that tradeoffs are _deliberate_, while drawbacks are _unwanted_.

## Eutrophication

Eutrophication is the presence of _**excessive**_ nutrients—like nitrogen and phosphorus—that causes great growth in algae. Both elements are sources from fertilizer, sewage, and other waste disposals products; these are all caused by humans.

### Environmental Effects

Algal blooms decrease the amount of available freshwater, resulting in the decrease of [marine biodiversity](#user-content-fn-8)[^8] and blocking sunlight for plant life. The decomposition of algae also consumes oxygen creating a "dead zone," which makes it impossible for marine life to thrive.

### Economic Effects

Secchi depth is a metric of water clarity calculated by lake type and total phosphorus concentration. The more phosphorus, the less value in Secchi depth. [Lakefront properties](#user-content-fn-9)[^9] are also priced based on Secchi depth. They decrease in value by **15.6%** for every meter decrease in Secchi depth.

Treatments[^10] that help restore natural lake chemical balance can cost _millions_ of US dollars, with a minimum of **$25,000**. Additionally, the cost of _drinking water_ also increases due the increase in water treatment at utilities.

### Human Health Effects

Every **1% increase** in harmful algae leads to a **0.3% increase** in the risk of death due to non-alcoholic liver disease. This is because algal blooms release toxins that damage places like the kidneys, liver, and brain.

In 2019, the CDC reported **63** human illness cases and **hundreds** of animals cases caused by harmful algal blooms. Treatment of these illnesses additionally [cost money](human-impact.md#economic-effects-1).

### Potential Solution

The introduction of specific plants can decrease algal blooms.

**Duckweed** is a plant that is recorded to have removed **99.1%** of nitrogen in the water and **90.8%** of phosphorus in the water. This is because it needs nitrogen and phosphorus to grow and does so rapidly.

The **water hyacinth** is another valid plant candidate. It has been recorded that concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus have decreased _**exponentially**_ as the number of water hyacinths increase.

## Bioaccumulation

Bioaccumulation is the buildup of a chemical[^11] in an organism’s tissues when it is absorbed _faster_ than it is broken down or excreted. This may happen when substances such as pesticides, heavy metals, or industrial chemicals steadily increase in concentration inside an organism over its lifetime. This buildup may happen when an organism eats contaminated food or [absorbs chemicals from water](#user-content-fn-12)[^12].

### Plastic Pollution

Plastics, especially microplastics, can carry or release chemicals[^13] that accumulate in the tissues of animals that ingest them. Over time, organisms exposed to these chemicals can reach harmful internal concentrations.

### Biomagnification

Biomagnification is the process where the concentration of a toxic substance increases at each higher level of a food chain, so _top_ predators end up with the _highest_ levels of the toxin.

Bioaccumulation in [small organisms](#user-content-fn-14)[^14] provides the starting point. Predators eat many contaminated prey, resulting in the chemicals moving up the food web to higher trophic levels.

### Biodiversity Loss

High concentrations of [harmful substances](#user-content-fn-15)[^15] can cause health problems like reproductive failure, developmental defects, behavioral changes, and organ damage in wildlife and humans. This negatively impacts biodiversity.

## Invasive Species

An invasive species is an alien[^16] plant, animal, or microbe that spreads rapidly and causes harm to the environment, economy, or human health.​ They are often introduced by [human activities](#user-content-fn-17)[^17] and then establish spreading populations in the wild.

### Environmental Effects

Invasive species outcompete native species for resources[^18], often causing population declines or extinctions and reducing overall biodiversity.​ They can alter _entire_ habitats and [ecosystem processes](#user-content-fn-19)[^19], which can _permanently_ change how ecosystems function.

### Economic Effects

Invasive species damage agriculture, forests, and fisheries, lower crop yields, and reduce the productivity of rangelands and timberlands,. They also clog waterways, foul beaches, damage boats and water intake systems, and reduce recreation and tourism opportunities.

All of these end up costing economies _billions_ of dollars each year.

### Human Health Effects

Some invasive plants and animals worsen allergies, skin irritation, or respiratory problems, and others can increase disease risk by hosting or spreading pathogens and disease vectors.​

By degrading water quality, increasing flooding or erosion, and harming livelihoods that depend on natural resources, invasives also create social and economic stress for communities.
