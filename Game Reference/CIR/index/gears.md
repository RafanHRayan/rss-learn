# Gears

**Gears** are supportive tools that users obtain after the end of each stage, ranging from useful support tools to boosts in damage. They are one of CIR's main mechanics, being the tools the user obtains at the end of each stage (every 10 waves).

## Gear Types

Users are only allowed one Gear from the Refresher and Active category, and two Gears from the Passive and Utility[^1] category.

Users are given a choice of four gears by default and will be given a gear from each category. Once the user reaches the limit for any given gear category, all gears from that category will no longer appear in the gear selection.

Gears are divided into four different categories:
