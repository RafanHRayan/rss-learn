# Study Steps

Try to follow these steps in order to study the most efficiently.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### <i class="fa-file-pen">:file-pen:</i> Know What to Study

Make sure you know what you need to know. This is important before studying.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### <i class="fa-book">:book:</i> Reading

Just read. Pretty boring, but don't underestimate the power of reading notes.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### <i class="fa-brain-circuit">:brain-circuit:</i> Mnemonics

If you can, mnemonics will help you _**very**_ much on the test, making things easier to memorize.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### <i class="fa-note">:note:</i> Writing

Rewrite your notes to ensure they are fresher in your mind. This can help with rote memorization, as writing helps you remember things easier.

If you want to take things a step further, you can try **blurting**. Blurting is when you write everything you remember about the material, correct or add anything you missed, and repeat iteratively. You should have the material well-known by the time you can recall _**almost every key detail**_ on the material.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### <i class="fa-question">:question:</i> Creating Custom Exams/Quizzes

Creating your own exams will force you to think about **how questions may come up on your exam**, which is very healthy for learning the material as well.

Once you can create your own exams, you have reached _**true mastery**_!
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### <i class="fa-bed">:bed:</i> Final Small Revisions

Never overdo it the day and night before the test. Light revisions are **all** that are necessary. Get a good night's sleep, and eat healthy the morning of the exam.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### <i class="fa-pencil">:pencil:</i> Test-Taking

Always stay calm and composed. **Never** get nervous because of time, but **never** forget about it either.

Always skip questions you don't understand and mark them to return to them later. This will ensure you don't spend _too long_ on a single question.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

**Good luck on your exams! :D**
