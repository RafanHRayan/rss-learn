# Combat Initiation Refurbished

[Combat Initiation Refurbished](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] is a fast-paced arena brickbattle game that doesn't exist anywhere but the **mind**. It takes on the neo-retro style of Roblox, and is _heavily_ based off of—in fact, an extended and slightly altered version of—the hit game [Combat Initiation on Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/games/13559635034/Combat-Initiation). Combat Initiation is, in turn, inspired by [Ultrakill](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL/).

The game "released" on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_, \_\_\_\_\_.
