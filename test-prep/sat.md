## English

### Craft and Structure

You may be asked to...

* Interpret the meaning of high‑utility words and phrases in context (words in context).
* Choose the best word or phrase to maintain a passage’s tone and style.
* Analyze how a sentence or paragraph is structured and how that structure contributes to meaning.
* Identify a text’s purpose (to explain, argue, describe, etc.).
* Determine the role of a sentence (introduce a claim, provide an example, counter an earlier point).
* Determine the point of view or perspective and how it shapes the text.
* Evaluate how an author’s choices (organization, emphasis, detail) affect readers.
* Analyze relationships between two short, related texts (agreement/disagreement, cause/effect, support/contrast).
* Compare how two texts treat the same topic or idea (cross‑text connections).

### Information and Ideas

You may be asked to...

* Identify explicit central ideas or main points.
* Determine key supporting details that best support a claim or main idea.
* Summarize a passage or part of a passage.
* Draw inferences from what is stated and select evidence that best supports an inference.
* Distinguish between main ideas and minor details.
* Interpret and use evidence from text (command of textual evidence).
* Interpret tables, bar graphs, and line graphs tied to a brief passage (quantitative evidence).
* Integrate information from text and an informational graphic.
* Identify whether a piece of evidence supports, weakens, or is irrelevant to a claim.
* Evaluate an argument’s use of evidence and reasoning (basic argument evaluation).
* Identify relationships like cause/effect, comparison, or sequence in informational texts.

### Standard English Conventions

You may be asked to edit sentences to follow core grammar, usage, and punctuation rules.

### Expression of Ideas

You may be asked to...

* Choose the sentence or phrase that best accomplishes a stated purpose (e.g., provide an example, clarify a claim).
* Add, revise, or delete material to improve focus and avoid redundancy.
* Improve the logical flow of ideas within or between sentences.
* Select the best transition word or phrase between ideas, sentences, or short paragraphs.
* Combine sentences for concision, clarity, and logical emphasis.
* Improve coherence and organization in a short passage (order of sentences, avoiding abrupt shifts).
* Integrate information from a small graphic where relevant to the rhetorical goal (in questions that reference data).

## Mathematics

### Algebra

Linear relationships and equations. You may be asked to...

* Solve linear equations in one variable (including with fractions and variables on both sides).
* Solve linear equations in two variables (find x or y for a given equation).
* Interpret and manipulate linear functions written in different forms (slope‑intercept, point‑slope, standard).
* Determine slope and intercepts from equations, graphs, or verbal descriptions.
* Interpret slope and intercepts in context (rate of change, starting value).
* Write linear equations to model word descriptions or data.
* Solve systems of two linear equations in two variables (algebraically and graphically).
* Interpret the meaning of solutions to systems (one solution, none, infinitely many; intersection in context).
* Solve linear inequalities in one variable.
* Represent linear inequalities in one or two variables on a number line or coordinate plane.
* Interpret solutions of inequalities and systems of inequalities in context.

### Advanced Math

Nonlinear equations and functions needed for higher‑level math. You may be asked to...

* **Equivalent expressions**
  * Simplify polynomial expressions (add, subtract, multiply).
  * Factor polynomials (common factor, trinomials, special products).
  * Manipulate rational expressions (simplify, identify restrictions).
  * Rewrite expressions involving exponents and radicals (including rational exponents).
  * Recognize when two expressions are algebraically equivalent.
* **Nonlinear equations in one variable & systems in two variables**
  * Solve quadratic equations (factoring, completing the square, quadratic formula).
  * Interpret the discriminant to determine number of solutions.
  * Solve equations involving square roots, rational exponents, or absolute values.
  * Solve equations involving exponential expressions.
  * Solve systems that include at least one nonlinear equation (e.g., line + parabola).
* **Nonlinear functions**
  * Interpret and analyze quadratic functions (vertex, axis of symmetry, zeros) from equations and graphs.
  * Interpret exponential functions (growth/decay rates, initial value) from equations and graphs.
  * Analyze polynomial functions more broadly (end behavior, zeros, multiplicity when given in simple forms).
  * Relate function graphs to equations and transformations (shifts, reflections, stretches/compressions) in basic cases.
  * Use function notation, evaluate functions, and interpret function values in context.
  * Understand and use absolute value functions (including V‑shaped graphs and piecewise interpretations).

### Problem-Solving and Data Analysis

Quantitative reasoning, statistics, and probability. You may be asked to...

* **Ratios, rates, proportions, units**
  * Work with ratios and proportional relationships (including scaling).
  * Use unit rates (e.g., cost per item, miles per hour) and convert units when needed.
  * Set up and solve proportion equations.
  * Interpret and compare rates in tables, graphs, and word contexts.
* **Percentages**
  * Compute percent increase and decrease.
  * Work with discounts, markups, taxes, and simple interest‑type situations (when they appear).
  * Find a part, whole, or percent given the other two.
  * Work with percentage points versus percent change.
* **Data: one variable**
  * Interpret distributions shown in dotplots, histograms, and boxplots.
  * Identify and use measures of center (mean, median) and spread (range, interquartile range, standard deviation, when referenced).
  * Reason qualitatively about how changes in data affect measures of center and spread.
* **Data: two variables**
  * Interpret scatterplots and identify trends (positive, negative, no association; linear vs nonlinear).
  * Use or compare lines of best fit (including using them to make predictions).
  * Interpret slope and intercepts of a regression line in context.
  * Work with two‑way tables and segmented bar graphs for bivariate categorical data (including relative frequencies).
* **Probability**
  * Compute simple probabilities from descriptions, tables, or tree‑type setups.
  * Interpret conditional probability from two‑way tables or verbal descriptions.
  * Decide whether events are independent or dependent from context or data.
* **Inference and statistical claims**

  * Judge whether a sample is likely representative, given how it was chosen.
  * Distinguish observational studies from experiments.
