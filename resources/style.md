# Style

**Style** is a show of skill, contribution, performance, and actions in combat. It is the only way to receive **score**.

A gauge bar is used to show the current amount of style one has. By receiving any **style bonus**, the style box will show up, showing the style gauge, current style bonuses, tier, color, and aerial multiplier. Style gradually goes down as less damage or style bonuses are gained.

### Aerial Multiplier

By staying in the air, an aerial multiplier starts to increase, capping at a multiplier of 2, upon landing on the next surface, the multiplier instantly resets.

## Ranks

**Ranks** are the six levels of performance: Xtreme, Superb, Awesome, Brilliant, Cool, and Dull. They are abbreviated in brackets as \[X!!], \[S!], \[A], \[B], \[C], and \[D].

In this context, they are used to measure overall performance in style. The more style, the more score you obtain and the higher rank you receive. Your rank lowers as style goes down.

Ranks are not just used for style, but in all places where performance is measured.

### Rank Multipliers

Ranks increase how much score is given for a style bonus.

|      Rank | Score Multiplier |
| --------: | ---------------- |
|      Dull | +0%              |
|      Cool | +25%             |
| Brilliant | +50%             |
|  Awesome! | +75%             |
|  Superb!! | +100%            |
| XTREME!!! | +200%            |

## Tiers of Style Bonuses

Style bonuses have tiers based on how difficult or powerful the style bonus is. They are the following...

<table><thead><tr><th width="269.578125" align="right">Tier</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="right">Tier 1</td><td>The lowest tier. Standard style bonuses and easiest obtainments fall under here.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Tier 2</td><td>Intermediate level style bonuses fall under here.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Tier 3</td><td>Advanced level style bonuses fall under here.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Tier 4</td><td>Elite style bonuses fall under here. These style bonuses are the most difficult or complicated to obtain and give the most score.</td></tr></tbody></table>
