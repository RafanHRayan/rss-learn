# First Civilizations

## Defining History

The dictionary definition of **history** states that history is the study of past events, particularly in human affairs.

Herodotus, who is known as the father of history[^1], recorded the history of the wars between the Greeks and the Persians around 2500 years ago. The way he wrote was unique, as he asked _questions_ instead of writing [how it was done before](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]. By inquiring about the war, he was able to write a narrative on it, which helped those in the future understand what _actually_ happened even though they didn’t actually experience it firsthand.

People who learned from Herodotus and did the same, eventually led to the present, where we record information akin to Herodotus today.

History is an inquiry into _why_ things from the past should still be important to us and _how_ they make an impact on the present.

## Humans

### Human Attributes

Many things that humans are known to do are actually done by other animals, so they can’t be what makes us unique. Some of the attributes that other animals also have include...

* ...using **tools**.
  * Also done by sea otters, apes, and crows.
* ...**building** structures.
  * Also done by beavers, apes, and bees.
* ...having a complex **community** (working together).
  * Also done by orcas and ants.
* ...creating **art**.
  * Also done by elephants (of all animals...)
* ...speaking a common **language**.
  * Also done by orcas.
* ...going to **war** against others of the same species.
  * Also done by apes.

Though we do not have any _specifically_ unique traits, we share all of them while other animals only have some of them.

### Evolution

**Evolution** is a theory, but it is hard to back evolution because of the time period it takes to properly notice it. More on evolution in the biology unit [here](https://rss-industries.gitbook.io/learn/sci/fundamental/biology/evolution).

With this problem in mind, Richard Lenski began an experiment with bacteria in 1988 named the **Lenski Experiment**: he separated the bacteria into twelve different containers and left them to duplicate.

For the bacteria, 24 hours roughly equates to approximately 6.67 generations and every 500 generations, a sample is frozen for future reference on how the bacteria looked on a specific date. The experiment is ongoing to this day.

In Image 1, the cell size of bacteria increased over thousands of generations. The reason for this is because of natural selection; it was better to be larger, so over time, smaller bacteria died out and larger bacteria thrived. This resulted in an increase in cell size of the overall population. This is also known as **the struggles for existence**.

During the process of biological change, random variations can also occur in the traits of individual organisms and are passed on to their offspring.

### Hominids

**Hominids** are any human-like organisms that are bipedal[^3] and intelligent[^4].

_Australopithecines_ are an ancestor of humans, existing about 3.2 million years ago. Lucy is the _only_ known australopithecus to be bipedal, making her famous for the reason we walk on two legs today.

[_Homo Habilis_](#user-content-fn-5)[^5] is the hominid that first began using stone tools, marking the beginning of the [Paleolithic Age](#user-content-fn-6)[^6]. They existed around 2 million years ago.

Much later on, only about 100,000 to 30,000 years ago, _Homo Neanderthalensis_ walked the Earth.

Finally, [_Homo Sapiens_](#user-content-fn-7)[^7] were found to have emerged 250,000 years ago in Africa. We still live on today.

## The Paleolithic Age

The Paleolithic Age happened between 2,000,000 BCE and 12,000 BCE. At this time, humans were hunter-gatherers, since they primarily hunted and gathered their food from wherever they could. Humans at the time lived in [small groups](#user-content-fn-8)[^8] and were nomadic, meaning they only travelled and never lived in one place permanently.

Our ancestors were affluent, meaning they had an abundant amount of free time. The reason humans are so different from other hominids is because of [Hyperactive Agent Detection Device](#user-content-fn-9)[^9] and the [Theory of Mind](#user-content-fn-10)[^10]. Humans are more creative, resulting in a leap in the development of art and religion.

Humans from the Paleolithic Age, as a result, created art on cave walls from pigments. This cave art can be found all over the world.$$\text{}$$

## The Neolithic Age

### Agriculture

Many hominids ended up migrating out of Africa and into other parts of the world. After the last ice age ended, humans began eating more various plant life, including seeds. A while later, they figured out that planting seeds from plants with a larger harvest will yield that same abundance in seed harvest.

<br>

The end of the ice age led to a more wet environment, so planting crops would yield in more crops. This led to the Neolithic Age23, where agriculture became the main source of food. Since humans needed more room for farming, it led to the agricultural intensification24 of land. Over time, the land’s trees were removed in favor of more land. As a result, people could plant and harvest more crops from the same amount of land as before. This led to there being a greater population.

<br>

Humans also figured out that only planting crops and harvesting with a high yield of harvest would lead to an abundance in those plants. In doing this artificial selection25, plants with a lower yield of harvest died out leaving only plants with higher yields.

<br>

Along with agriculture however, the domestication26 of livestock like cows, goats, sheep, and chickens followed. This led to pastoralism27, in which people practice herding as the primary economic activity of a society.

<br>

All of these new changes allowed humans to sustain more people, leading to larger civilizations and permanent settlements. Though it all seems to be positive, agriculture led to not the most prettiest sights of human history.

<br>

The biggest mistake of farming was humans’ overall ability to survive. The hard work of farming caused humans to have poorer health, a shorter lifespan, and hard labor for a majority of the people.

## Civilization and Its Elements

The eight elements of civilization28 are as follows:

* Organized Religion
  * A form of religion.
  * All people worshipped a god or gods.
* Social Classes
  * There is an upper class and a lower class.
  * The lower class is usually in a poorer condition in comparison to higher classes.
* Art and Architecture
  * A large way humans expressed creativity and religion was through art.
  * Buildings are built in a certain way on purpose.
* Cities
  * The settlement covers a huge amount of land and can house thousands of people.
* Infrastructure
  * Buildings are built in a uniform way to allow easy travelling between places in a city.
* System of Writing
  * A writing system is used to keep track of amounts, places, and people.
* Job Specialization
  * Every type of task is covered by people who specialize in it.
* Central Government
  * There is a single ruler above everyone else.

<br>

A settlement does not need every single element to be considered a civilization.

## Early Examples of Places

### Gobekli Tepe

The Gobekli Tepe29 predates agriculture. Knowing this, many people were surprised since the nomadic people of the Paleolithic Age wouldn’t have the time to build a structure like this if they were constantly moving from place to place.

<br>

Gobekli Tepe was built with so much dedication because it is believed to be result of religion, leading many to think that it is a temple.

<br>

### Catal Huyuk

Catal Huyuk30 was one of the earliest civilizations of the Neolithic Age. There were no roads. Instead, people used ladders to let roofs access other roofs; every building had a way to get to its roof.

<br>

Though, Catal Huyuk was very advanced for its time, it is not considered to be a full-blown civilization, as it lacked some qualities that later-established civilizations had.
