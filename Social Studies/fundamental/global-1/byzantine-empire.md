# Byzantine Empire

## Formation of the Byzantine Empire

After [Diocletion split up Rome](the-rise-of-monotheism.md#roman-tetrarchy), result civil wars split up the east and western halves of Rome into separate territories. [Constantine](the-rise-of-monotheism.md#constantine) then reunites Rome and legalizes Christianity about a decade later.

Ultimately, "barbarians" conquer the eastern portion of Rome, known as [the death of Rome](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]; [the remaining part of Rome](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] begins to develop further.

### Origins of the Byzantine Empire

The Byzantine Empire was originally a Greek city-state founded around 600 BCE by King Byzas. It was kept alive by Greco-Roman culture.

### Defense Measures

To further defend what was now left of Rome, the capital (Constantinople) decided to build towering walls and fastened iron chains across [the Golden Horn](#user-content-fn-3)[^3] to prevent ships from crossing.

## Justinian

Justinian was not anyone of royal blood. His uncle—who was originally a pig farmer—made his name for himself as a soldier in the army. He continued to gain more and more support until he was declared emperor. Justinian was named emperor after his uncle died.

### Theodora

Theodora also wasn't of royal blood. Her father was a bear-trainer, but she was named co-empress by Justinian. Justinian consulted her on political matters.

From 527-565 CE, Justinian sought to [renovate Rome](#user-content-fn-4)[^4], first increasing the territory of the Byzantine Empire. Consequently, the Byzantine Empire reached greatest size under Justinian and Theodora,&#x20;who both wanted to rebuild the Roman Empire.
