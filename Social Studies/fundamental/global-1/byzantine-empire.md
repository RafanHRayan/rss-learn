# Byzantine Empire

## Formation of the Byzantine Empire

After [Diocletion split up Rome](the-rise-of-monotheism.md#roman-tetrarchy), result civil wars split up the east and western halves of Rome into separate territories. [Constantine](the-rise-of-monotheism.md#constantine) then reunites Rome and legalizes Christianity about a decade later.

Ultimately, "barbarians" conquer the eastern portion of Rome, known as [the death of Rome](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]; [the remaining part of Rome](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] begins to develop further.

### Origins of the Byzantine Empire

The Byzantine Empire was originally a Greek city-state founded around 600 BCE by King Byzas. It was kept alive by Greco-Roman culture.

### Defense Measures

To further defend what was now left of Rome, the capital (Constantinople) decided to build towering walls and fastened iron chains across [the Golden Horn](#user-content-fn-3)[^3] to prevent ships from crossing.

## Justinian

Justinian was not anyone of royal blood. His uncle—who was originally a pig farmer—made his name for himself as a soldier in the army. He continued to gain more and more support until he was declared emperor. Justinian was named emperor after his uncle died.

### Theodora

Theodora also wasn't of royal blood. Her father was a bear-trainer, but she was named co-empress by Justinian. Justinian consulted her on political matters.

From 527-565 CE, Justinian sought to [renovate Rome](#user-content-fn-4)[^4], first increasing the territory of the Byzantine Empire. Consequently, the Byzantine Empire reached greatest size under Justinian and Theodora,&#x20;who both wanted to rebuild the Roman Empire.

## The Hippodrome

The Hippodrome was a horseracing arena. Similar to the colosseum, Justinian had a seperate, isolated seat from others.

### The Nika Riots

The racers were accused of murder and were sent for execution. Public outrage spilled in the form of fierce riots. Justinian was set to leave, yet Theodora convinced him to stay and deal with the problems.

To solve this problem, Justinian encased all the rioters in the Hippodrome and slaughtered them. 30,000-50,000 people were killed. Much of the city was also burned, which led to Justinian setting out a massive campaign of unity.

The Nika riots showed that instead of listening to their concerns, Justinian would choose to silence his people by killing them.

## The Justinian Code

5,000 laws from the Law Code, which were the old laws from the past Rome, were reused in the Byzantine Empire. Roman law had survived the fall or Rome. In addition to this, the Novellae[^5] contained all the new laws that Justinian passed after 534 CE.

The Justinian Code served as the legal basis for criminal justice, marriage, property, and slavery. While the code reformed some, it was rather unreformed for others, as it denied Jews and homosexuals the right to government jobs or inheritance.

Theodora made sure that women’s rights were advanced in this code...

* Women could now own property.
* Infanticide[^6] was outlawed.
* Housing was provided for unhoused women
* Penalties for sexual assault increased.

## The Hagia Sophia

The Hagia Sophia was the largest church at it's time, with engineering and architecture that marvelled the world.
