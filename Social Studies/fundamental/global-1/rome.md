## The Beginnings of Rome

### Rome's Founding

Rome started off as a monarchy when it was founded by brothers, Romulus[^1], in 753 BCE.

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-file-lines">:file-lines:</i> <strong>Piece 1</strong> — Rome’s Founding Mythology</summary>

According to Roman mythology, the founders of Rome were Romulus and Remus. The twin-brothers were the sons of the god Mars and the priestess Rhea Silvia. The story begins with the deposition 1 of Numitor (their grandfather and king of the ancient Italian city of Alba Longa). Numitor's daughter, Rhea Silvia, became a priestess of the goddess Vesta 2 and was therefore forbidden to marry. However, the god Mars (his name was Ares in Greece) came to her in her temple, and they conceived two sons, Romulus and Remus.

As soon as they were born, Romulus and Remus were placed in a basket and abandoned in the River Tiber because their mother was not supposed to have children. This practice was a form of infanticide 3 tolerated in many ancient cultures, including the Roman and Greek, when children were unwanted. The Tiber then flooded and when the waters fell, the basket containing the two boys came ashore. They were found by a she-wolf, who instead of killing them, looked after them and fed them with her milk. The she-wolf was helped by a woodpecker, who brought them food. Both of these animals were sacred to Mars (Ares). Romulus and Remus were then discovered by a shepherd, who brought the children to his home and raised the boys as his own.

When they grew up, Romulus and Remus reinstated Numitor, their grandfather, as King of Alba Longa, and then decided to found a city of their own. Romulus and Remus chose the place where the she-wolf had nursed them. Romulus began to build city walls, but Remus mocked them because they were so low. He leaped over them to prove this, so Romulus killed him. Romulus continued building a new city, naming it Roma (Rome) after himself. Its first citizens were outlaws and fugitives.

However, there were not enough wives for all the city’s men, so Romulus decided to steal women from the Sabines, another Italian tribe. As a trick, he announced a festival and invited many Sabines to it. While the Sabine men were distracted, Romulus and his friends carried off the women. The Sabine men were furious and, led by their king Titus Tatius, declared war on Romulus. When the fighting had reached its peak, the Sabine women, who had grown fond of their Roman husbands, begged both sides to make peace. So the battle was stopped, and Romulus and Titus Tatius ruled together over the two peoples until Titus Tatius was killed in battle. For the rest of his life Romulus ruled alone, proving himself a great leader in peace and war. Romulus disappeared one day in a violent storm. The Romans believed he had been taken up to heaven and worshipped him as a god.

</details>

From Passage 1, we can find out about the upbringing of the brothers Remus and Romulus. They were abandoned[^2] and raised by a she-wolf. This is significant, as wolves tend to be animals representing _courage_.

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-file-lines">:file-lines:</i> <strong>Piece 2</strong> — Sabine Kidnapping Account Excerpt</summary>

\[They], had the courage to throw themselves amid the flying weapons, imploring their fathers on the one side, their husbands on the other, "that as fathers-in-law and sons-in-law they would not contaminate each other with impious blood, If you are dissatisfied with the affinity between you, if with our marriages, turn your resentment against us; we are the cause of war. It were better that we perish than live widowed or fatherless without one or other of you.

— Sabine Women, Livy - Ab Urbe Condita

</details>

The story about the kidnapping of Sabine women shows how the new women of Rome are strong enough to stress the belief of family. The Sabine women are said to rather die than be without one or the other, showing their close connection with both sides fighting.

Romulus, as the first king, dies around 716 BCE. His six successors to the throne all contribute to the building of Rome.

|        Roman King | Ruling Period |
| ----------------: | ------------- |
|           Romulus | 753-716 BCE   |
|    Numa Pompilius | 715-673 BCE   |
|  Tullus Hostilius | 673-641 BCE   |
|     Ancus Marcius | 641-616 BCE   |
| Tarquin the Elder | 616-579 BCE   |
|    Servius Tulius | 579-535 BCE   |
| Tarquin the Proud | 534-509 BCE   |

The monarchical stage of Rome ends due to an incident with the final Roman king's son.

### The Roman Political Shift

The son of Tarquin the Proud is caught to have assaulted Lucretia, a Roman noblewoman who was renowned for her virtue[^3]. After her assault, she was found to have committed suicide.

> “With Servius, true kingship came to an end; never again was a Roman king to rule in accordance with humanity and justice.” — Livy

This incident shocked the Romans. Her body was taken to the Roman Forum and she becomes a symbol of _oppression_. Rome revolts against kings, swearing to _never_ allow one person to grasp too much power again. After the banning of monarchy, Rome debates on the best form of government, eventually becoming a republic.

### The Roman Republic

Rome shifts from a monarchy to a republic in 509 BCE. A republic[^4] is a _type_ of democracy. Unlike in Athens—which was a direct democracy—the people would choose elected officials to govern instead.

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-file-lines">:file-lines:</i> <strong>Piece 3</strong> — Polybius' Account of Rome's Republic</summary>

The following excerpt is the description of the Roman constitution provided by the Greek historian Polybius in his book The Histories written between 167-119 BCE, a period of rapid Roman expansion. Polybius greatly admired the Romans, and the purpose of his work was to describe how Rome came to dominate the world.

The Roman constitution has three elements. Each of them possesses independent powers, and their share of power has been so well regulated that no one can say for sure whether the constitution is an aristocracy[^5] or democracy or despotism[^6].

The Consuls (magistrates[^7]) lead the military and are the supreme masters of the government.\
They bring matters requiring debate before the Senate. They also call together the people's Assemblies, and carry out whatever the majority of the Assemblies decide. They have absolute authority in running the military and fighting wars and can spend as much public money as they choose. Seeing these powers would justify our describing the constitution as a despotism.

The Senate proposes laws and has the control of the treasury. It also handles all crimes requiring an investigation. In addition, if it is necessary to send diplomats to a foreign country to make peace or to proclaim war, this too is the business of the Senate. As a result, many foreign kings imagine the constitution is a complete aristocracy because nearly all the business they had with Rome was settled by the Senate.

After all this, someone would naturally ask what part is left for the people in the constitution.\
There is, however, a part left to the people (the Assemblies), and it is a most important one. It is the people in the Assemblies who grant office to those that deserve it through the elections. The Assemblies also have the final say in passing or repealing laws, and most important of all it is that they make the final decision on the question of peace or war. These considerations again would lead one to say that the chief power in the state was the People's, and that the constitution was a democracy.

— Polybius

</details>

Immediately after Rome shifted to a republic, the social class altered. From highest to lowest in class was as follows.

<table><thead><tr><th width="229.875" align="right">Ranking/Class</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="right">Patricians</td><td>The Patrician class was the <em>ruling</em> class. They were those who could trace their lineage back to the founding fathers of Rome. They consisted of wealthy landowners, consuls, and senators.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Plebeians</td><td>The Plebeian class was all other citizens of Rome. They consisted of small farm owners, and had little to no rights or say in government.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Freemen</td><td>The freemen were slaves who were released by owners. They had approximately the same rights as the Plebeian class, yet were exalted lower. Most became craftsmen and traders.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Slaves</td><td>Pretty self-explanatory. Prisoners of war enslaved to do housework, mining, farming, etc.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## The Punic Wars

From 264-146 BCE, Rome slowly began to amass more territory. This got the attention of another settlement called Carthage. Rome and Carthage conflicted due to their unanimous want of the island of Sicily.

### Carthage

Carthage was a Phoenician settlement founded in 814 BCE. The Phoenicians[^8] were highly into trade, primarily trading purple dye. Purple dye was very difficult to obtain and expensive to get; it was considered a color of royalty. In Latin, the Phoenicians were translated as the Punics.

{% hint style="info" %}
### Clarification

The Carthaginians are the Phoenicians are the Punics. All of these are just synonymous titles given to the _same_ settlement.
{% endhint %}

They had the strongest navy in the region at the time.

> “No man could wash his hands in the salt water without the permission of Carthage.”

The navy of Carthage was a double harbor, used dually for trade _and_ military.

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2026-01-13 at 7.10.44 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p><strong>Image 1</strong> — Diagram of Carthaginian Double Harbor</p></figcaption></figure></div>

From Image 1, you can see that the narrow portion of the harbor was for commercial use. Merchants would line the boarders, leaving room in the center for military units; the latter were lined up in the inner portion of the harbor. This made docking very easy and fast.

### Roman Preparation

Rome had a problem, however; they had no navy! Their solution was ingenuity[^9]. The Romans recovered a Carthaginian shipwreck and reverse engineered it to understand how they were built and what the use case was. They then used that information to build their own warships.

The Romans had strength on foot, but were forced to fight at the sea. To combat this, they invented the Roman Corvus. It was essentially a mini bridge attached to the mast with a nail at the bottom of one end. This nail allowed the bridge to latch onto other boats when dropped. Roman soldiers could then march onto Carthaginian boats and attack there.

### The First Punic War

The First Punic War, happening at Sicily from 264-241 BCE, hailed the Romans victorious. The Romans were now in control of Sicily. Hamilcar, the general of Carthage remained ashamed[^10].

The Second and Third Punic Wars happen from 218-146 BCE.

### Hannibal and The Second Punic War

Hannibal, the son of Hamilcar, is enraged by the embarrassment Carthage has faced.

> "I swear that so soon as age will permit...I will use fire and steel to arrest the destiny of Rome." — Hannibal the Conqueror \[as a young boy, \~9 yrs of age]

From 218-201 BCE, Rome was attacked by the Carthaginian army, now led by Hannibal.

Hannibal did this for several reasons. One, was to compel Rome to abandoning their planned assault on Carthage. Secondly, they wanted to cut off Roman trade alliances. Hannibal crosses [two entire mountain ranges](#user-content-fn-11)[^11] and gets to Rome by foot, instead of directly sailing to Rome.

#### Roman Counteraction

Scipio Africanus, the current Roman general, countered Hannibal by going directly to Rome. He then threaten Hannibal: either the latter is to protect his city, or continue the fight at Rome and watch Carthage burn down.

#### The Battle of Zama

In 202 BCE, Scipio fights Hannibal, where the Romans are—once again—victorious, resulting in over 20,000 casualties. Carthage was forced to surrender all territory out of Africa, [wage war only with Roman permission](#user-content-fn-12)[^12], and pay a massive indemnity[^13] to Rome over 50 years.

### The Third Punic War

Cato, a prominent senator, wants to destroy what is left of Carthage. In fact, Cato said the same statement at _every_ speech he gave.

> ["Carthago delenda est!"](#user-content-fn-14)[^14] — Cato, Roman senator

The wealth of Carthage—even after the foreboding terms the Romans had inflicted—disgusted him.

In 150 BCE, Carthage was given pressure from the Numidians expanding into their territory. Since the Numidians were a Roman ally, they had no power to retaliate. When Carthage gives in to attacking the Numidians, Rome attacked Carthage for violation of the peace treaty made after the Battle of Zama.

From 149-146 BCE, The Third Punic War commenced, where Carthage was destroyed. Afterwards, the Romans went to surrounding places where Carthaginians had fled. These escapees were then sold to slavery.

> "A glorious moment, Polybius; but I have a dread foreboding that some day the same doom will be pronounced on my own country." — Scipio Aemilianus, Adoptive grandson of Scipio Africanus
>
> "A day will come when sacred Troy shall perish, And Priam and his people shall be slain." — Homer

Scipio knew that one day, Rome would fall too, and that there was nothing anyone could do to stop it.

## The Struggle of The Orders

The Punic Wars allowed for Rome to start its domination, starting the Middle Republic (264-133 BCE).

In 494 BCE, the position of tribune was created, which gave the plebeians the ability to veto laws and established the Plebeian Assembly. The roman Republic became more representative as time passed, causing plebeian outrage. Afterwards, the Plebeians slowly gained more political power. In 342 BCE, Plebeians gained the ability to be a Consul. In 287 BCE, laws passed by the Plebeian Assembly was to apply to all Romans.

The flow of wealth in the Mediterranean caused by the expansion of Rome, caused tons of goods to be exported back to Rome. Though this seems to be a good thing at first glance, the surplus of wealth and resources led to [more stretched social classes](#user-content-fn-15)[^15].

Whoever controlled the government also controlled the wealth; this enticed government positions further.

### Latifundia

Latifundias[^16] were typically specialized in the production of goods like grain, olive oil, and wine. [Owners of these latifundias started to purchase smaller nearby farms.](#user-content-fn-17)[^17] Senators benefited the most from this activity. A crisis is then caused by the creation of latifundias: the, now, unemployed farmers move to cities in search of job opportunities. Those that were given housing there had to live in _suffering_ conditions.

> “Not only were \[city] buildings unheated...they contained airless rooms, indecently overcrowded: though poor in all the facilities that make for decent daily living, they were in addition so badly built and so high that they offered no means of safe exit from frequent fires that occurred. And if their tenants escaped typhoid, typhus, fire, they might easily meet their death in the collapse of the whole structure…The main population of the city that boasted its world conquest lived in cramped, noisy, airless, foul smelling, quarters and paid extortionate rents to merciless landlords.” — Mumford

Income inequality grew and [violence became more common in politics](#user-content-fn-18)[^18]. To respond to this, the Gracchi brothers scheme on a possible solution.

### Tiberius Gracchus

The older of the two, Tiberius Gracchus sought to fix the rising problems of the Struggle of The Orders.

> “You fight and die to give luxury to other men...but you have not a foot of ground to call your own.” — Tiberius Gracchus

He started by _**attempting**_ to limit the size of rich estates, redistribute lands to the poor, and distribute grain to the poor. Because of his wills to help the general public, the Patrician class refuses to fund his land distribution plan.

#### Tiberius's Assassination

When Attalus III gave the Kingdom of Pergamum to Rome, Tiberius used this fund to implement his plan anyway. When he ran for re-election—something that was very frowned upon in Rome—a group of senators publicly clubbed Tiberius to death. His opponents thought he was trying to become a king because of his defiance against the Senate and his wish for re-election.

### Gaius Gracchus

As Tiberius's younger brother and successor to power, Gaius Gracchus desired to follow his brother's steps. Gaius also believed the Roman government had to address problems of common people. He emphasized this symbolically by turning his back on the Senate and speaking directly to the people. After running for re-election, Gaius won, breaking prior Roman political norms.

Gaius secured the passage of the following laws:

* The lowering of the cost of food.
* The right of citizens to appeal death sentences.
* The resettlement of the poor in areas of Rome with available land.
* The criminalization of bribery in Roman politics.

After Gaius is also assassinated, the Senate passed an Extreme Powers Act, giving immense power to the Consuls. One of such, Lucius Opimius, arrests and executes over 3,000 Gracchans.

## Roman Republic Civil Wars

By now, socials classed have stretched even further, starting The Late Republic (133-31 BCE).

Army leaders came to rule Rome, forming separate armies that fought against each other for power. Plebeians who required a job and found them in these private armies.

### Julius Caesar

Julius Caesar is born in 100 BCE to the Patrician class. He received Greek education, which is where he entered the career of politics. With his wish to be well-known, Caesar held many games allowing free entry to all. This caused him to gain popularity, though putting him in severe debt. To leave this debt, Caesar decided to co-rule with two other powerful men, creating the First Triumvirate.

Pompey was a Roman general with a powerful army, Crassus was of the wealthy, and Caesar was the popular one. Caesar was given imperium[^19] in Gaul, where he ruled and conquered with his own private army. He, however, was not given imperium in Italy[^20].

> ["Veni vidi vici."](#user-content-fn-21)[^21] — Julius Caesar$$\text{}$$

The Senate is nervous about his success and popularity, eventually declaring him—along with Pompey—as an enemy of Rome. They demand that Caesar give up all of his holdings in Gaul and come back as a private citizen. He is ordered to arrive in Italy and to pass the Rubicon not with his army.

> ["The die is cast."](#user-content-fn-22)[^22] — Julius Caesar

Caesar goes back to Rome, yet he brings is army, disobeying Roman orders. If Caesar is to lose, he will be put as a traitor; if he wins, he receives ultimate power.

### Caesar's Rise to Power

The First Triumvirate ends upon the death of the two others. Crassus dies to war in a campaign in Turkey. Crassus flees to Egypt, where he is mercilessly beheaded. Caesar is the only one to remain and no one challenges him; the Senate declares him as dictator for life.

{% hint style="success" %}
### Extra Note

Traditionally, those deceased prior are printed on coins. Julius Caesar was the first _**currently living**_ man to appear on a Roman Republican coin.
{% endhint %}

Caesar does many actions to help the public.

<table><thead><tr><th width="199.92578125" align="right">Action</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="right">Public Works</td><td>Caesar helped create jobs for the poor &#x26; provided new buildings (Forum Julium, Curia Julia, and Basilica Julia) to enhance the look of the city</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Expansion of Senate</td><td>Caesar expanded Senate form 600 to 900 members &#x26; appointed his supports to the Senate. Some of these supporters were Plebeians!</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Poor &#x26; Veterans</td><td>Caesar distributed public lands to the poor &#x26; veterans. He will set up colonies throughout Roman World to ensure veterans had land.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Citizenship</td><td>Caesar granted Roman citizenship to many people in Rome’s provinces including Gauls, who fought alongside him. This allowed more people to participate in government.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">Food</td><td>Caesar regulated grain purchases. He oversaw grain operations carefully so that poor Romans could get access to food. He forbade those who could afford privately supplied grain from purchasing from the state grain supply.</td></tr></tbody></table>

1-2 months after Caesar is elected as dictator for life is when he is assassinated by Roman senators. After Caesar's death, a power vacuum is left, where many will try to seize. Caesar's rise to power marks the end of the Roman Republic.

### Marc Antony's Funeral Speech

When Marc Antony was given permission to give a speech at Caesar's funeral, he was specifically told not to celebrate him for his success. As a workaround, Antony realized to the public that Caesar's killers will receive backlash. He warned them of what was to come following Caesar's death.

### Caesar's Successors

Marc Antony was one of Caesar's best generals, making him feel like he deserved to be the successor of Caesar. Gaius Octavian—the adoptive mentee of Caesar—felt that he deserved to be the heir. Caesar's son—whom everyone called Little Caesar—was the biological son of Caesar and Cleopatra of Egypt, making him also want the honor of Caesar's heir.

Octavian and Antony make an agreement, where Antony will rule the eastern portion of Rome and Octavian will rule the western portion of Rome. Antony looks onto Cleopatra for financial and military help; Cleopatra uses this opportunity to manipulate Antony and gain power.

Octavian steals Antony's will[^23] an publicly exposes him by reading it aloud. It contained the statement that Antony would like to leave his assets to his "beloved" Cleopatra; Octavian brought light to Cleopatra's actions and waged war, starting the Battle of Actium (31 BCE). Octavian is victorious against Cleopatra and Antony.

Octavian changes his name to Augustus[^24], claiming the title of Princeps[^25] and Imperator[^26]. Octavian is Augustus Caesar. Augustus's rise to power marks the end of the Roman Republic and the civil wars.

## Slavery in Rome

Slavery was [used in Rome](#user-content-fn-27)[^27] as early as 1000 BCE, but skyrocketed in popularity—and population of slaves—in the third or second century BCE due to the taking of Carthage. By the first century BCE, slaves accounted for 30-40% of Italy.

### Jobs of Slaves

A slave's job varied, depending on their previous profession from before their land was captured. If you were a butler, you were enslaved as a butler; if you were a teacher, you were enslaved as a teacher; and so on.

Those that didn't have a profession, were sent to work in agriculture.

### Treatment of Slaves

Especially rich slaveholders tended to have multiple, taking them as property with a [welded metal collar](#user-content-fn-28)[^28] or tattoo. A slaves treatment was entirely up to the slaveholder; many slaves were respected with tombs and urns, but others were treated as if they weren't even human.

Slaves were not subject to the same laws, and could be given worse punishments than even the lowest of citizens of Rome.

> "There is a proverb: 'You have as many enemies as you have slaves.' But in truth we make them our enemies. We abuse them as if they were beasts of burden. When we recline for dinner, one wipes our spittle, another picks up the scraps and crumbs thrown down by drunkards. The point of my argument is this: 'treat your inferior as you would like to be treated.'" — Seneca

### Servile Wars

Many slaves did as they were told, but others violently rebelled. Spartacus, an enslaved soldier escapee, became a leader in an uprising against The Roman Republic. This led to the Servile Wars in 73 BCE, where thousands of slaves rose up and demanded freedom.

Eventually, Spartacus was killed in battle against an army led by [Crassus](rome.md#julius-caesar); the revolt fell apart.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Aftermath

Approximately 6,000 rebel slaves were crucified along the _Via Appia_.
{% endhint %}

## Pax Romana

For 207 years, Rome—after transitioning from a republic to an empire—began to experience immense provisions of peace, wealth, and expansion.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Note

Pax was the Roman goddess of peace.
{% endhint %}

During this time, there were more status of Augustus than any other Roman ruler to date, portraying Augustus as religious[^29], commanding[^30], political[^31], and godlike[^32].

### Bread and Circus

_Panem Et Circenses_ meant "Bread and Circus" and represented the building and hosting of games at the colosseum. The colosseum was built in approximately 70 CE.

The colosseum had free entry, even to the poor. If you _were_ poor, you could go there for free food and entertainment. The ideal was that it was your leader that gave you this.

At the colosseum, gladiator games were held. The colosseum was built by enslaved Jews.

## Judaism

Judaism developed as a monotheistic religion from polytheistic Mesopotamian beliefs.

### Abraham and Isaac

Abraham is asked by God to kill his son, Isaac. He almost does so, but is stopped by an angel who begs him to not, saying he has proven his faith, fear, and devotion to God.

### Book of Job

The Book of Job attempts to answer why bad things happen to good people, saying that life isn't fair to anyone and it should not cause anyone to lose their covenant[^33] with God.

### Birth of Moses

Following a famine, the Hebrews [moved to Egypt](#user-content-fn-34)[^34] in about 1700 BCE.

Abraham and his followers are said to have grown so numerous and powerful that they were forced into slavery. They were so feared in Egypt that the pharaoh himself commanded every newborn Israelite be drowned in the Nile.

Moses was spared from this punishment! The Pharaoh’s daughter found him, abandoned and alone in the river, and raised him as Egyptian royalty.

Moses eventually led the Israelites out of Egypt to the Sinai Desert in a mass exodus[^35]. During the journey, God gave Moses the 10 commandments.

### The Ten Commandments

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-scroll-torah">:scroll-torah:</i> The Ten Commandments</summary>

That which is given to Moses on Mount Sinai...



1. I am the lord—your God—who brought you out of Egypt. You shall have no other gods.
2. You shall not make or worship idols.
3. You shall not swear falsely by the name of the Lord your God.
4. Remember the Sabbath[^36] and keep it holy.
5. Honor your father and mother.
6. You shall not murder.
7. You shall not commit adultery.
8. You shall not steal.
9. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
10. You shall not covet your neighbor’s belongings.

</details>

The Torah is a _scroll_, not a book. It is not just the text that is sacred, the _object_ itself is sacred. At synagogues, a new section of the Torah is read each week by a Rabbi.

{% hint style="warning" %}
## Warning

* The Torah is focused on **the here and now**.&#x20;
* God gave these laws to show them how to live a Jewish life.
* The Torah alludes to an afterlife but there is a lot of interpretation as to what that may be.



You follow the law to be a good Jew, _**not**_ to reap any rewards in the afterlife.
{% endhint %}

### The First Jewish Temple

King Solomon (961-922 BCE) brought the Hebrew Kingdom to its height, constructing the First Jewish Temple. In 722 BCE, the Assyrians (From Mesopotamia) conquered Israel. Solomon's temple is destroyed.

Upon the conquests of Cyrus the Great, religious tolerance is taken into effect and Solomon's temple is rebuilt.

#### Hanukkah

The region would come under control of Antiochus in 175 BCE. He wanted to “hellenize” the regions and eliminate threat of Judaism. To do this, they slaughtered pigs (which were considered unclean) inside of the temple, essentially desecrating[^37] it.

The successful revolt against Antiochus led to the Jewish celebration of Hanukkah.

### Conquest of Rome

Upon the conquest of Rome, the Arch of Titus was built to commemorate. Jewish people refused to walk under this arch. In 70 CE, the temple was destroyed. In 66 CE, Jews in Rome rebelled and took Jerusalem. Four years later, Rome retook Jerusalem and enslaved the Jews there, causing a diaspora[^38] across the entirety of the Roman empire.

{% hint style="success" %}
## Fun Fact

This diaspora is, in part, why Jewish people are so diverse today. Despite this, Jewish people take up only 0.2% of the world population.
{% endhint %}

### The Prominent Problem of Monotheism

Through the Romans were tolerant of all religions, you were required to take part in the rituals of the state religion. To the Romans, Judaism was seen as _foreign_ cult[^39].

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-file-lines">:file-lines:</i> <strong>Example of Cults</strong> — Cult of Mithras</summary>

The Cult of Mithras was a cult of the Persian sun god Mithras that reached Rome in the first century CE.

</details>

## Christianity

### Roman Religion

Roman religion [followed Greek mythology but changed the names of the gods](#user-content-fn-40)[^40]. It was less of a spiritual experience and more of a "contractual" relationship between man and the gods. Sacrifice to the gods means that you would be rewarded!

In 6 CE, Augustus Caesar turned the Kingdom of Judah into the Roman province of Judea. During this time, Jews split into those who cooperated with Rome and those who didn't.

### Jesus Christ

In the bible, God was said to have sent the Angel Gabriel to Mary to give her the message that she was going to give birth to Jesus. Jesus's birth is celebrated on Christmas.

Jesus was said to have been born in Bethlehem under a volatile society, where Judea was under Roman control and was heavily taxed and suppressed[^41]. Not much is known about Jesus's childhood, but as an adult, Jesus was said to have been a Jewish Rabbi who followed Jewish law but wanted reforms.

Jesus meditated in the desert, fasting for 40 days. During this time, the Devil is said to have visited Jesus to try to tempt him with food. Jesus resisted all of this. Today, Christians honor this as Lent, where they give up something they love for 40 days.

### Jesus's Message

Essentially, Christianity emerged out of Judaism. In the midst of the confusion and conflict in Judea, Jesus began his public preaching.

He was said to have performed several miracles...

* He turned water into wine.
* He fed multitudes of people with just a few loaves and fish.
* He walked on water.
* He raised [the dead](#user-content-fn-42)[^42].

> "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say to you, if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to that person the other cheek." — Jesus Christ

Christianity appealed to the poorest of the plebeian class, slaves, women, and soldiers.

> "Our Roman gods demand sacrifices from their subjects. Without their blessings, the Roman Empire is doomed. Yet those who follow the teachings of Christ refuse to make sacrifices to the gods, claiming that their God is the only true god. What nonsense!!! Those silly people and their silly ideas. They should get on their knees and worship the ground that Jupiter and Minerva have create." — Maximus, Roman Governor

### Death and Resurrection of Jesus

The night before Jesus was arrested for treason, he blessed his last Passover dinner. Under the reign of Tiberius, Rome executed Jesus via crucifixion.

Christians believe that after three days, Jesus rose from the dead and later ascended into heaven. In Christianity they call this event the resurrection of Christ. Christians believe that by rising from the dead, Jesus saved humanity from their sins. This is what Christians celebrate on Easter.

After Jesus' death, his disciples said he had risen from the dead, confirming his status as Messiah. The Apostles—his closest followers—began preaching and writing that Jesus was the Son of God. Christians formed their own churches for worship, fellowship, and instruction.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Note

Those who believed in these teachings were Christians.
{% endhint %}

Christianity begins in 30 CE. Most people around Jesus (disciples) couldn’t read or write so they told stories. By 200 CE there may have been as many as fifty Gospels although there are only _four_ in the Bible.

In 202 CE, Rome issued a law forbidding future conversion, persecution of Christians would follow. The Government was struggling and much of the instability was blamed on Christians. Eventually, Rome makes practicing Christianity punishable by _death_.

### First Days of Christianity

Christianity was a proselytizing[^43] religion. Christian’s belief in one God threatened the emperor’s power/ability to control his people. Judaism was different because Jews recognized Roman political authority and did not try to convert people. Christians spread their ideas throughout the empire, which undermined Roman authority.

### Gospels

Before the Bible was compiled, it wasn't clear on what happened and what didn't. For example, the Gospel of John recognizes Jesus as the incarnate God. Jesus’s deification[^44] was different. The sole human manifestation of the only God in the universe. Many others recognized Jesus in different ways.

## Creation of a Christian Rome

### Roman Tetrarchy

Emperor Diocletian divided the Empire into a tetrarchy. This quickly became a civil war and led to the rise of Constantine.

### Constantine

Legend has it that Constantine had a dream where he saw [a symbol in the sky](#user-content-fn-45)[^45] and the words "conquer by this." When he wakes up, he has the symbol emblazoned onto soldier's shields. As he goes to war, Constantine goes on to reunite the empire.

Constantine appoints Christian advisors and Bishops to the emperor’s court. He confiscates pagan[^46] treasuries. He builds and repairs Christian Churches and grants tax concessions to the Christian Leaders.

This appeals all Romans to Christianity, and religion begins to determine politics.

### Clarification of Christianity

Tertullian of Carthage (160-220 CE) had an idea, called _trinitas_. It stated that God was [the Father](#user-content-fn-47)[^47], [the Son](#user-content-fn-48)[^48], and [the Holy Spirit](#user-content-fn-49)[^49], yet each of the three were not each other.

### Council of Nicaea

As Christianity and politics became more intertwined, Constantine sought to unify the Church. In 325, Constantine called the Council of Nicaea to establish a set Christian Orthodoxy. The Church had to be unified for the Empire to be unified.

### Creation of the First Official Bible

There were about 50 gospels, yet only 4 were approved by Constantine; the others were removed. The removed gospel typically contradicted the beliefs of Constantine and were, consequently, not favored.

For example, The Gospel of Thomas eliminates the need for priests. Constantine wants priests to maintain the new Christian Orthodoxy and to provide organization. To accept the Gospel of Mary Magdalene would be to accept that women can have a place in the Church, and therefore the government. Thus, both were omitted.

Hours before his death, Constantine was baptized to unify the Roman Empire by legalizing Christianity, supporting the church, and cleansing his sins.

### Theodosius I

Despite the Nicene Creed, many Christians continued to read banned gospels and held unapproved beliefs. Many Romans also continued to practice the polytheistic Roman religion and followed sacred cults like Mithras.

Theodosius I made a few changes...

* He made haruspicy[^50] punishable by death.
* He ended [the Olympics](#user-content-fn-51)[^51] in Greece.
* He encouraged the destruction of Pagan temples.
* He made Pagan holidays workdays.

Eventually, Christianity and Pagan celebrations blend together, fostering practices like handing ornaments on a tree on Christmas.
