# Rise of Monotheism

## Judaism

Judaism developed as a monotheistic religion from polytheistic Mesopotamian beliefs.

### Abraham and Isaac

Abraham is asked by God to kill his son, Isaac. He almost does so, but is stopped by an angel who begs him to not, saying he has proven his faith, fear, and devotion to God.

### Book of Job

The Book of Job attempts to answer why bad things happen to good people, saying that life isn't fair to anyone and it should not cause anyone to lose their covenant[^1] with God.

### Birth of Moses

Following a famine, the Hebrews [moved to Egypt](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] in about 1700 BCE.

Abraham and his followers are said to have grown so numerous and powerful that they were forced into slavery. They were so feared in Egypt that the pharaoh himself commanded every newborn Israelite be drowned in the Nile.

Moses was spared from this punishment! The Pharaoh’s daughter found him, abandoned and alone in the river, and raised him as Egyptian royalty.

Moses eventually led the Israelites out of Egypt to the Sinai Desert in a mass exodus[^3]. During the journey, God gave Moses the 10 commandments.

### The Ten Commandments

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-scroll-torah">:scroll-torah:</i> The Ten Commandments</summary>

That which is given to Moses on Mount Sinai...



1. I am the lord—your God—who brought you out of Egypt. You shall have no other gods.
2. You shall not make or worship idols.
3. You shall not swear falsely by the name of the Lord your God.
4. Remember the Sabbath[^4] and keep it holy.
5. Honor your father and mother.
6. You shall not murder.
7. You shall not commit adultery.
8. You shall not steal.
9. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
10. You shall not covet your neighbor’s belongings.

The Torah is a _scroll_, not a book. It is not just the text that is sacred, the _object_ itself is sacred. At synagogues, a new section of the Torah is read each week by a Rabbi.

{% hint style="warning" %}
## Warning

* The Torah is focused on **the here and now**.&#x20;
* God gave these laws to show them how to live a Jewish life.
* The Torah alludes to an afterlife but there is a lot of interpretation as to what that may be.



You follow the law to be a good Jew, _**not**_ to reap any rewards in the afterlife.

### The First Jewish Temple

King Solomon (961-922 BCE) brought the Hebrew Kingdom to its height, constructing the First Jewish Temple. In 722 BCE, the Assyrians (From Mesopotamia) conquered Israel. Solomon's temple is destroyed.

Upon the conquests of Cyrus the Great, religious tolerance is taken into effect and Solomon's temple is rebuilt.

#### Hanukkah

The region would come under control of Antiochus in 175 BCE. He wanted to “hellenize” the regions and eliminate threat of Judaism. To do this, they slaughtered pigs (which were considered unclean) inside of the temple, essentially desecrating[^5] it.

The successful revolt against Antiochus led to the Jewish celebration of Hanukkah.

### Conquest of Rome

Upon the conquest of Rome, the Arch of Titus was built to commemorate. Jewish people refused to walk under this arch. In 70 CE, the temple was destroyed. In 66 CE, Jews in Rome rebelled and took Jerusalem. Four years later, Rome retook Jerusalem and enslaved the Jews there, causing a diaspora[^6] across the entirety of the Roman empire.

{% hint style="success" %}
## Fun Fact

This diaspora is, in part, why Jewish people are so diverse today. Despite this, Jewish people take up only 0.2% of the world population.
{% endhint %}

### The Prominent Problem of Monotheism

Through the Romans were tolerant of all religions, you were required to take part in the rituals of the state religion.

<details>

<summary><i class="fa-file-lines">:file-lines:</i> <strong>Example of Cults</strong> — Cult of Mithras</summary>

The Cult of Mithras was a cult of the Persian sun god Mithras that reached Rome in the first century CE.

</details>

To the Romans, Judaism was seen as _foreign_ cult[^7].

## Christianity

### Roman Religion

Roman religion [followed Greek mythology but changed the names of the gods](#user-content-fn-8)[^8]. It was less of a spiritual experience and more of a "contractual" relationship between man and the gods. Sacrifice to the gods means that you would be rewarded!

In 6 CE, Augustus Caesar turned the Kingdom of Judah into the Roman province of Judea. During this time, Jews split into those who cooperated with Rome and those who didn't.

### Jesus Christ

In the bible, God was said to have sent the Angel Gabriel to Mary to give her the message that she was going to give birth to Jesus. Jesus's birth is celebrated on Christmas.

Jesus was said to have been born in Bethlehem under a volatile society, where Judea was under Roman control and was heavily taxed and suppressed[^9]. Not much is known about Jesus's childhood, but as an adult, Jesus was said to have been a Jewish Rabbi who followed Jewish law but wanted reforms.

Jesus meditated in the desert, fasting for 40 days. During this time, the Devil is said to have visited Jesus to try to tempt him with food. Jesus resisted all of this. Today, Christians honor this as Lent, where they give up something they love for 40 days.

### Jesus's Message

Essentially, Christianity emerged out of Judaism. In the midst of the confusion and conflict in Judea, Jesus began his public preaching.

He was said to have performed several miracles...

* He turned water into wine.
* He fed multitudes of people with just a few loaves and fish.
* He walked on water.
* He raised [the dead](#user-content-fn-10)[^10].

> "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say to you, if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to that person the other cheek." — Jesus Christ

Christianity appealed to the poorest of the plebeian class, slaves, women, and soldiers.

> "Our Roman gods demand sacrifices from their subjects. Without their blessings, the Roman Empire is doomed. Yet those who follow the teachings of Christ refuse to make sacrifices to the gods, claiming that their God is the only true god. What nonsense!!! Those silly people and their silly ideas. They should get on their knees and worship the ground that Jupiter and Minerva have create." — Maximus, Roman Governor

### Death and Resurrection of Jesus

The night before Jesus was arrested for treason, he blessed his last Passover dinner. Under the reign of Tiberius, Rome executed Jesus via crucifixion.

Christians believe that after three days, Jesus rose from the dead and later ascended into heaven. In Christianity they call this event the resurrection of Christ. Christians believe that by rising from the dead, Jesus saved humanity from their sins. This is what Christians celebrate on Easter.

After Jesus' death, his disciples said he had risen from the dead, confirming his status as Messiah. The Apostles—his closest followers—began preaching and writing that Jesus was the Son of God. Christians formed their own churches for worship, fellowship, and instruction.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Note

Those who believed in these teachings were Christians.
{% endhint %}

Christianity begins in 30 CE. Most people around Jesus (disciples) couldn’t read or write so they told stories. By 200 CE there may have been as many as fifty Gospels although there are only _four_ in the Bible.

In 202 CE, Rome issued a law forbidding future conversion, persecution of Christians would follow. The Government was struggling and much of the instability was blamed on Christians. Eventually, Rome makes practicing Christianity punishable by _death_.

### First Days of Christianity

Christianity was a proselytizing[^11] religion. Christian’s belief in one God threatened the emperor’s power/ability to control his people. Judaism was different because Jews recognized Roman political authority and did not try to convert people. Christians spread their ideas throughout the empire, which undermined Roman authority.

### Gospels

Before the Bible was compiled, it wasn't clear on what happened and what didn't. For example, the Gospel of John recognizes Jesus as the incarnate God. Jesus’s deification[^12] was different. The sole human manifestation of the only God in the universe. Many others recognized Jesus in different ways.

## Creation of a Christian Rome

### Roman Tetrarchy

Emperor Diocletian divided the Empire into a tetrarchy. This quickly became a civil war and led to the rise of Constantine.

### Constantine

Legend has it that Constantine had a dream where he saw [a symbol in the sky](#user-content-fn-13)[^13] and the words "conquer by this." When he wakes up, he has the symbol emblazoned onto soldier's shields. As he goes to war, Constantine goes on to reunite the empire.

Constantine appoints Christian advisors and Bishops to the emperor’s court. He confiscates pagan[^14] treasuries. He builds and repairs Christian Churches and grants tax concessions to the Christian Leaders.

This appeals all Romans to Christianity, and religion begins to determine politics.

### Clarification of Christianity

Tertullian of Carthage (160-220 CE) had an idea, called _trinitas_. It stated that God was [the Father](#user-content-fn-15)[^15], [the Son](#user-content-fn-16)[^16], and [the Holy Spirit](#user-content-fn-17)[^17], yet each of the three were not each other.

### Council of Nicaea

As Christianity and politics became more intertwined, Constantine sought to unify the Church. In 325, Constantine called the Council of Nicaea to establish a set Christian Orthodoxy. The Church had to be unified for the Empire to be unified.

### Creation of the First Official Bible

There were about 50 gospels, yet only 4 were approved by Constantine; the others were removed. The removed gospel typically contradicted the beliefs of Constantine and were, consequently, not favored.

For example, The Gospel of Thomas eliminates the need for priests. Constantine wants priests to maintain the new Christian Orthodoxy and to provide organization. To accept the Gospel of Mary Magdalene would be to accept that women can have a place in the Church, and therefore the government. Thus, both were omitted.

Hours before his death, Constantine was baptized to unify the Roman Empire by legalizing Christianity, supporting the church, and cleansing his sins.

### Theodosius I

Despite the Nicene Creed, many Christians continued to read banned gospels and held unapproved beliefs. Many Romans also continued to practice the polytheistic Roman religion and followed sacred cults like Mithras.

Theodosius I made a few changes...

* He made haruspicy[^18] punishable by death.
* He ended [the Olympics](#user-content-fn-19)[^19] in Greece.
* He encouraged the destruction of Pagan temples.
* He made Pagan holidays workdays.

Eventually, Christianity and Pagan celebrations blend together, fostering practices like hanging ornaments on a tree on Christmas.

## The Branching of Christianity

After Constantine, Christianity splits into two similar religions at around 700 CE due to an argument in Christianity.

Icons[^20] were used at the time to keep believers in remembrance of God. Emperor Leo III wanted to remove icons, doing so in 726 CE. He felt that icons were sinful as they were made by painters for the sinful thought of profit, and attempted to represent something that couldn't be represented. Iconoclasts[^21] and iconodules[^22] clashed, causing riots.

Emperor Leo III's outlaw of icons was removed in 780 CE. Christianity, however, was split. Iconoclasts became Orthodox Christians; iconodules became Catholic Christians.
