## The Purpose of a Government

### Government’s Importance

Governments are essential to societies. They help to organize agriculture, conduct trade within cities and between other cities, create laws that help to provide social stability, oversee religious rituals, and even provide for defense and expansion.

In ancient Mesopotamia, the government resided inside a large temple known as a ziggurat. Inside, priests supervised the temple and property. They were considered to be powerful because they were thought to be able to communicate with the gods.

Lower down in rank, professional writers worked to keep track of records and information. Writing was very important for this reason, and at around 3000 BCE, Cuneiform—latin for “wedge-shaped”—emerged.

### Cuneiform

At first, Cuneiform was a language of pictographs. This means that it used pictures to represent different objects and ideas. Eventually, however, Cuneiform evolved into a phonetic system. Our alphabet is a phonetic system, as it uses symbols to represent sounds, instead of objects. These sounds then go together into words that represent different objects.

### Hammurabi

Hammurabi was the king of Babylon from 1792 to 1750 BCE, and he was the one to unite all of Mesopotamia under the Babylon Empire.

The stele that had etched on the entirety of Hammurabi’s Code also depicted—at the very top—Hammurabi receiving his royal insignia from Shamash, the god of the Sun and divine justice. The entire stele was 7’4”, making it seem commanding to even the illiterate.

Law codes attempt to establish the rule of law by defining criminal acts and punishing violators of those acts. Hammurabi’s code unified Mesopotamia into one empire, but the laws were filled with tons of strict penalties and gender/class discriminations.
